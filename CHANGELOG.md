## Unreleased

### Added

- **Fish Audio voice provider suite** — TTS (S2.1-Pro / S2-Pro) and ASR land in
  both SDKs, wired end-to-end with real pricing. One `FISH_AUDIO_API_KEY`
  covers both directions of the call:
  - **`FishAudioTTS`**: HTTP streaming synthesis via `POST /v1/tts`, default
    model `s2.1-pro` (83 languages, multi-speaker via `<|speaker:N|>` markers,
    natural-language `[bracket]` expression control). Output defaults to
    PCM_S16LE @ 16 kHz so chunks feed the pipeline with no transcoding, and
    `latency` defaults to `balanced` (~300 ms). Fish selects the model with a
    **request header**, so switching generations is a constructor argument.
    `for_twilio()` requests PCM directly at 8 kHz — the carrier wire rate — so
    the pipeline skips the resample (Fish has no native G.711, so the μ-law
    encode still runs); `for_telnyx()` keeps the 16 kHz pipeline rate. Every
    unset knob is omitted from the request so Fish applies its own documented
    default rather than one the SDK guessed.
  - **`FishAudioWebSocketTTS`**: opt-in low-latency transport over
    `wss://api.fish.audio/v1/tts/live`, pairing with `s2-pro`'s ~100 ms
    time-to-first-audio and skipping the per-utterance HTTP setup. Fish serves
    **only `s1` and `s2-pro`** on that socket, so the constructor rejects
    `s2.1-pro` up front with a pointer back to the HTTP adapter instead of
    failing mid-call. Frames are MessagePack (`start`→`text`→`flush`→`stop`),
    which is the sole reason the `[fish_audio]` extra pulls in `ormsgpack`
    (TypeScript: `@msgpack/msgpack`, an optional dependency).
  - **`FishAudioSTT`**: batch transcription via `POST /v1/asr`. Fish exposes no
    streaming socket, so the adapter buffers ~2 s windows and emits one final
    transcript each — no interim partials, same shape as `WhisperSTT`. A short
    tail is silence-padded up to Fish's documented 1-second floor rather than
    dropped, so the last words of an utterance are never lost. Server errors
    are logged and yield no transcript; they never raise into a live call.
  - **Pricing** (official, docs.fish.audio): TTS $15.00 per 1M UTF-8 **bytes**
    (`s2.1-pro-free` free), ASR $0.36 per audio hour. The adapters meter UTF-8
    byte length rather than character count — exact for latin scripts and
    correctly ~3× higher for CJK.

  `docs/{python,typescript}-sdk/providers/fish-audio-{tts,stt}.mdx`. Beta:
  validated against the Fish Audio API spec with real local HTTP/WebSocket
  servers in the test suite; not yet exercised on a live call.

- **xAI (Grok) voice provider suite** — all three xAI Voice APIs land in both
  SDKs, wired end-to-end with real pricing:
  - **`XaiRealtime` engine (Grok Voice Agent API)**: real-time speech-to-speech
    over `wss://api.x.ai/v1/realtime` (default model `grok-voice-latest`, voice
    `eve`). The protocol is OpenAI-Realtime-GA-compatible, so the adapter
    subclasses the GA adapter and inherits audio streaming, barge-in, and the
    full tool-calling bridge (`transfer_call`/`end_call` included). xAI-specific
    session knobs are exposed opt-in: `reasoning_effort` (`"high"`/`"none"`),
    VAD `threshold`/`prefix_padding_ms`/`idle_timeout_ms`, ASR
    `language_hint`/`keyterms`, output `speed`, pronunciation `replace` map,
    session `resumption`, and raw `server_tools` passthrough for xAI
    server-side tools (`web_search`, `x_search`, `mcp`, `file_search`).
  - **`XaiSTT`**: streaming speech-to-text over `wss://api.x.ai/v1/stt`
    (binary frames, `transcript.created` handshake, chunk/utterance finals,
    Smart Turn end-of-turn detection, keyterm biasing, diarization) plus a
    batch `transcribe()` helper for `POST /v1/stt` (word timestamps, ITN
    formatting, 25 languages).
  - **`XaiTTS`**: one-shot streaming synthesis via `POST /v1/tts` with the
    26-voice Grok roster, `for_twilio()` (native G.711 µ-law 8 kHz) /
    `for_telnyx()` (PCM16 16 kHz) carrier presets, and a
    `create_custom_voice()` helper for `POST /v1/custom-voices` voice cloning.
  - **Pricing** (official, docs.x.ai): Realtime $0.05/min, TTS $15.00/1M chars,
    STT $0.20/hr streaming ($0.10/hr batch). `calculate_realtime_cost` /
    `calculateRealtimeCost` gain an optional duration argument to support
    per-minute realtime billing (token-based path unchanged).

  `libraries/typescript/src/providers/xai-{stt,tts,realtime}.ts`,
  `engines/xai.*`, `pricing.*`, docs pages under
  `docs/{python,typescript}-sdk/providers/xai-*.mdx`. Beta: validated against
  the xAI API spec and mocked protocol tests; not yet exercised on a live call.

### Fixed

- **`gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview` is now actually usable** (field-debugged on
  the Pillar demo line; fixed in both SDKs):
  - Setup: `enableAffectiveDialog`/`proactivity` are dated-2.5-native-audio-only
    knobs — on the flash-live family the server never sends `setupComplete`
    ("session ready timeout"). The TypeScript adapter now drops them (with a
    warning) on flash-live models. No-op in Python, which does not expose these
    knobs and so never sent them.
  - Tool calls: in the default BLOCKING function-call mode 3.1 halts audio at
    the `toolCall` and never resumes after the response (silent stall until the
    caller hangs up; hit on real calls where the model tools mid-conversation).
    Both SDKs now opt flash-live into the async mode (`behavior: NON_BLOCKING`
    on the declaration + `scheduling: INTERRUPT` on the response), and log the
    tool round-trip at info.
  - Adds `GeminiLiveModel.LIVE_3_1_FLASH_PREVIEW` to the Python model enum,
    matching the exported `GEMINI_LIVE_3_1_FLASH_PREVIEW` constant in TypeScript.
  `libraries/typescript/src/providers/gemini-live.ts`,
  `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/gemini_live.py`.

## 0.7.1 (2026-07-03)

### Added

- **Opt-in destination policy for the built-in `transfer_call` tool**
  (hardening for GH issue #205 — prompt-injected toll fraud). The transfer
  destination is chosen by the LLM, which is steerable by caller speech, and
  the only gate was E.164 *format* — a successful prompt injection could
  direct a billable outbound leg to any attacker-chosen (premium-rate)
  number. New `Patter.agent()` options `transfer_allowed_numbers` /
  `transfer_allowed_prefixes` (Py) — `transferAllowedNumbers` /
  `transferAllowedPrefixes` (TS) — restrict destinations to an exact-number
  allowlist and/or E.164 prefix allowlist (union). Enforced at every guard
  site BEFORE the carrier REST call (OpenAI Realtime `function_call`,
  Pipeline built-in handler, ElevenLabs ConvAI client tool), rejecting with
  the standard `{"error": ..., "status": "rejected"}` envelope so the agent
  keeps the call. Unset (default) preserves today's behaviour byte-identical;
  an empty list denies all transfers. Allowlist entries are validated at
  `agent()` construction (fail fast on typos).
  `libraries/python/getpatter/{client,models,stream_handler}.py`,
  `telephony/common.py`; `libraries/typescript/src/{client,types,stream-handler}.ts`.
- **Opt-in wall-clock outbound audio pacing (pipeline mode).** `Agent.paced_output`
  (Py) / `AgentOptions.pacedOutput` (TS) routes outbound carrier audio through a
  fixed 20 ms / 160-byte (μ-law) frame grid instead of the default event-driven
  burst send. A precomputed silence frame (μ-law `0xFF`×160 / PCM16 zero) fills
  gaps so an empty queue never stalls the clock and the first tick pays no encode
  cost (no cold-start latency), and a drift-corrected monotonic-deadline loop
  keeps the stream wall-clock-aligned — eliminating post-pause bursts. On a
  barge-in the pacer's queued backlog is dropped in the same beat as the carrier
  flush. Default off ⇒ byte-identical to today. New `getpatter/audio/pacer.py` /
  `src/audio/pacer.ts` (`OutboundFramePacer`), wired in `stream_handler`.
- **Krisp noise-cancellation denoiser selection (bring-your-own-license).**
  `Agent.denoiser` (Py) / `AgentOptions.denoiser` (TS) selects a Krisp model by
  its stable id — `"krisp-viva-tel-v2"` (VIVA telephony, NC session) or
  `"krisp-bvc-o-pro-v3"` (Background Voice Cancellation, BVC session) — resolved
  to an `AudioFilter` in the existing pre-STT chain slot. Ships **zero** Krisp
  binaries/models: it loads the operator's own `krisp_audio` SDK +
  `KRISP_VIVA_SDK_LICENSE_KEY` + `KRISP_MODELS_DIR`, with clear fail-fast errors
  when the SDK/license/model is absent. `denoiser` and `audio_filter` are parallel
  opt-ins (explicit `audio_filter` wins). New `providers/denoiser.py` /
  `providers/denoiser.ts` registry.
- **Text-based semantic end-of-turn detector (NAMO Turn Detector v1, Apache-2.0).**
  New `NamoTurnDetector` (`providers/namo_turn_detector.py` / `.ts`) implements the
  existing `TurnDetectorProvider` over the rolling conversation transcript (ONNX,
  runtime-loaded, `onnxruntime` + HF tokenizer as optional deps). The `predict`
  contract gained a backward-compatible keyword-only `transcript` argument, so the
  audio-native smart-turn detector is unchanged; the pipeline now assembles the
  last few turns + in-flight utterance and passes them on each end-of-turn check.
  Opt-in via `agent.turn_detector`; default behaviour unchanged. The tokenizer
  loader accepts a `revision=` argument (`PATTER_NAMO_REVISION` env var), so a
  Hugging Face Hub repo id `tokenizer_path` can be pinned to an immutable
  commit/tag rather than a mutable branch.
- **Opt-in barge-in re-delivery of the un-heard remainder (pipeline mode).**
  `Agent.redeliver_interrupted` (Py) / `AgentOptions.redeliverInterrupted` (TS):
  when the agent is interrupted mid-answer and the un-heard remainder still
  matters, the next turn gets a one-shot system nudge so the LLM answers the
  caller's new message first and then, only if still relevant, resumes the
  unfinished idea naturally (rather than silently dropping it). The
  worth-resuming decision is a pluggable `RedeliveryPolicy` (default: gate on a
  non-trivial un-heard remainder). New `services/redelivery.py` / `.ts`. No-op in
  realtime mode. Default off ⇒ zero behaviour change.
- **Soniox v5 real-time STT adopted (both SDKs).** `SonioxModel` gains
  `STT_RT_V5 = "stt-rt-v5"` and the default model flips `stt-rt-v4` →
  `stt-rt-v5` (the GA v5 model, released 2026-06-16); `v4`/`v3`/`v2` stay
  reachable for back-compat. v5 is fully API-compatible (same WS endpoint,
  in-band `api_key`, request/token-stream shape), so this is a model-id swap
  plus two new opt-in v5 endpoint controls (`endpoint_sensitivity` /
  `endpointSensitivity` in `[-1.0, 1.0]`; `endpoint_latency_adjustment_level` /
  `endpointLatencyAdjustmentLevel` in `0|1|2|3`), omitted from the wire when
  unset so existing behavior is byte-identical. Real-time rate unchanged at
  $0.12/hr ≈ $0.002/min (https://soniox.com/pricing).
- **Soniox TTS provider (both SDKs).** `SonioxTTS` over the REST one-shot
  `https://tts-rt.soniox.com/tts` bytes endpoint (`tts-rt-v1`, default voice
  `Adrian`, shares the `SONIOX_API_KEY` credential with Soniox STT).
  `forTwilio` / `forTelnyx` emit `pcm_mulaw` @ 8 kHz natively for carrier-wire
  passthrough (no resampling). Wired end-to-end: package-root export
  (`SonioxTTS`), `providers.soniox_tts()` / `sonioxTts()` config helper,
  `_create_tts_from_config` `"soniox_tts"` branch, and a pricing entry modeled
  per-1k-chars from the $0.70/hr headline (~$0.013/1k chars; native billing is
  token-based — https://soniox.com/pricing). Reuses the existing `[soniox]`
  extra (aiohttp).
- **Sarvam AI TTS provider for Indian languages (both SDKs).** `SarvamTTS` over
  the REST `https://api.sarvam.ai/text-to-speech` endpoint — Bulbul v3 (default)
  / v2 across 11 Indian languages (Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada,
  Malayalam, Marathi, Gujarati, Punjabi, Odia, Indian English) plus code-mixed
  text. `forTwilio` / `forTelnyx` emit `mulaw` @ 8 kHz natively (carrier-wire
  passthrough). Wired end-to-end: package-root export (`SarvamTTS`),
  `providers.sarvam()` config helper, `_create_tts_from_config` `"sarvam"`
  branch, a new `[sarvam]` pyproject extra (aiohttp), and a per-1k-chars pricing
  entry — Bulbul v3 ≈ $0.036/1k (Rs 30/10k), v2 ≈ $0.018/1k (Rs 15/10k); INR is
  authoritative, USD indicative (https://www.sarvam.ai/api-pricing).
- **Engine markers shipped: `GeminiLive`, `GeminiCascade`, and a native
  `InworldRealtime`.** 0.7.0 exported the Gemini pipeline factory + adapter but
  not the `GeminiLive` engine marker, so `new GeminiLive({...})` / the engine
  import failed at runtime; and there was no native Inworld realtime engine.
  Now `import { GeminiLive, GeminiCascade, InworldRealtime } from "getpatter"`
  resolves at runtime. The richer `GeminiLiveAdapter` (mulaw8↔PCM telephony
  transcode, apiVersion auto-detect, `GEMINI_LIVE_3_1_FLASH_PREVIEW`) plus
  `GeminiSTT`/`GeminiTTS` are integrated; `InworldRealtimeAdapter` subclasses the
  OpenAI Realtime adapter and overrides only the transport
  (`wss://api.inworld.ai/v1/realtime`, Bearer/JWT) via Inworld's OpenAI-Realtime
  migration path. Backward compatible — OpenAIRealtime / OpenAIRealtime2 /
  Ultravox / ConvAI unchanged.

### Fixed

- **Gemini Live spoke the model's "thinking" before the reply** (native-audio,
  every turn). The Live setup now always sends `thinkingConfig` with a voice
  default of `thinkingBudget: 0` (OFF), opt-in via `thinking`/`thinkingBudget`
  on `GeminiLiveOptions`; and the adapter defensively drops any `thought===true`
  part from BOTH the audio stream and the text transcript (never logged).
- **`gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview` dropped the call with a silent "session
  ready timeout".** It is a native-audio model served only on `v1alpha`, but its
  id lacks the `native-audio` token so the heuristic chose `v1beta`. New
  `geminiRequiresV1Alpha()` selects `v1alpha` for native-audio AND
  `flash-live-preview` (explicit `apiVersion` overrides); connect failures now
  throw a clear, actionable error (model id + resolved apiVersion + root causes)
  instead of dead air.

### Changed

- **Barge-in "heard prefix" is now word-accurate.** On an interruption, the
  conversation history is truncated to what the caller actually heard down to a
  word boundary mid-sentence, instead of rounding up to whole sentences from a
  byte estimate. Per-sentence segments now carry their playout duration, and the
  played position is taken from the best available source — Twilio
  carrier-confirmed per-sentence marks, else the wall-clock pacer's emitted
  position (when `paced_output`), else the byte estimate. An internal heard/unsaid
  split backs the new re-delivery feature. Telnyx/Plivo (no reliable marks) use
  the pacer/estimate tiers.
- **`@google/genai` peerDependency bumped `^0.3.0` → `>=2.0.0`** (kept optional)
  for the 2.x unified SDK, so `npm install getpatter` alongside
  `@google/genai@^2.x` no longer needs `--legacy-peer-deps`.
- **`create-getpatter` launcher realigned to the SDK version (lockstep).** The
  launcher pins the `getpatter` version it bootstraps to its own version, so it
  now tracks the SDK again (`npm create getpatter` provisions the current SDK).

### Security

- **Media-stream WebSockets are now authenticated (both SDKs, all carriers) —
  fixes #204.** The carrier webhook HTTP routes were signature-validated, but
  the media-stream WS endpoints (`/ws/stream/…` Twilio, `/ws/telnyx/stream/…`,
  `/ws/plivo/stream/…`) accepted any peer with an attacker-chosen `call_id`
  (the only control was a DoS per-IP cap). Anyone who could reach the public
  host could open the socket, send a `start` frame, and drive a full
  STT→LLM→TTS session on the operator's provider keys (toll fraud) or converse
  to extract the agent's system prompt + tool list. Now the signature-validated
  webhook (which builds the stream URL/TwiML) mints a high-entropy per-call
  token, delivers it on each carrier's existing custom channel (Twilio
  `<Parameter>` → `customParameters`, Telnyx URL query, Plivo `extra_headers`),
  and the WS handler constant-time-validates it **before** opening any provider
  session — an unauthenticated peer is closed (WS 1008) with no provider connect
  and no TTS. Fail-closed by default via the new `require_stream_auth` /
  `requireStreamAuth` option (opt-out for operators serving custom TwiML, which
  then logs a warning). The token is never logged. The webhook mints only for a
  legitimate (signed) carrier, so the token is a shared secret an unsigned
  attacker cannot obtain. Backward compatible for the standard `serve()`
  inbound + outbound path (the SDK mints/embeds/validates transparently). Also
  hardened the forgeable-`X-Forwarded-For` per-IP cap with a global concurrent-
  WS backstop, documented as DoS-cap-only now that auth is enforced separately.

## 0.7.0 (2026-06-30)

### Added

- **Inworld integration completed: full TTS pricing, a config helper, and an
  Inworld Realtime Router LLM (OpenAI-compatible) preset.** The Inworld TTS
  adapter shipped already; this fills in the rest:
  - **Pricing corrected & completed** (both SDKs) to the On-Demand list rates
    from https://inworld.ai/pricing (per 1k chars): `inworld-tts-2` $0.025,
    `inworld-tts-1.5-max` $0.035, and the previously-missing
    `inworld-tts-1.5-mini` $0.015 (replacing the placeholder rates).
  - **`providers.inworld()` TTS config helper** in both SDKs; Python's
    `TTSConfig(provider="inworld")` path now builds the adapter
    (`_create_tts_from_config`), closing the gap vs the other TTS providers.
  - **`InworldLLM`** — a thin preset over the OpenAI-compatible LLM provider
    targeting the Inworld Realtime Router (`https://api.inworld.ai/v1`,
    `INWORLD_API_KEY`), unlocking 220+ models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google,
    Mistral, DeepSeek, Meta, …) behind one key. Uses the distinct
    `inworld_router` provider key so token-based LLM cost is never confused with
    the char-based TTS pricing. `getpatter/llm/inworld.py`, `src/llm/inworld.ts`.
  Note: a standalone Inworld STT provider and the Realtime speech-to-speech
  engine (WebSocket/WebRTC + JWT) are tracked as separate follow-ups.

- **Inbound audio front-end: opt-in high-pass / DC-block and speech-selective
  AGC, plus inbound sample-rate validation.** The pipeline inbound chain
  (caller → STT) gained the two canonical audio-processing stages it was
  missing, both provider-agnostic, opt-in, and fail-open:
  - `Agent.high_pass_hz` (Py) / `highPassHz` (TS) — a 2nd-order Butterworth
    high-pass / DC-block (typical 80–120 Hz) runs as the FIRST stage, before
    AEC, so DC offset, mains hum (50/60 Hz) and handling rumble never reach the
    echo canceller, VAD or STT. `None`/undefined (default) leaves audio
    byte-identical to before.
  - `Agent.agc` (`bool | AgcConfig`) — speech-selective automatic gain control
    runs after noise suppression and before VAD/STT, normalising the caller's
    level toward a target RMS to cut WER on quiet / variable-distance talkers.
    Silence gaps are not amplified (the gain releases toward unity) and a
    per-frame peak limiter prevents clipping. `false`/undefined (default) keeps
    today's behaviour; `true` uses defaults; pass `AgcConfig` to tune.
  - `InputProcessingChain` now takes `input_sample_rate` / `inputSampleRate`
    (default 16000): a non-mu-law PCM16 carrier at a non-16 kHz rate is
    resampled to 16 kHz instead of being forwarded blind (a PCM16 @ 8 kHz
    stream previously reached STT pitched up an octave).
  The final inbound order is `HPF(opt) → resample → AEC(opt) → audio_filter/NS(opt)
  → AGC(opt) → VAD → STT`. New pure-DSP modules `audio/high_pass.py` +
  `audio/agc.py` (Py) and `audio/high-pass.ts` + `audio/agc.ts` (TS), wired in
  `services/input_chain.py` / `services/input-chain.ts`, `stream_handler.py` /
  `stream-handler.ts`, `models.py` / `types.ts`, `client.py` (TS via spread).

- **TTS providers declare their output format; carrier-native μ-law passthrough
  generalised.** Pipeline TTS adapters can now expose `sourceAudioFormat()`
  (TS) / `source_audio_format()` (Py) returning `{ encoding, sampleRate }`, and
  Cartesia gained an `encoding` option (`pcm_s16le` default, `pcm_mulaw` for
  carrier-native output). A new single source of truth (`audio/format.ts` /
  `getpatter/audio/format.py`) maps each carrier to its wire format (μ-law
  8 kHz on Twilio/Telnyx/Plivo) so the pipeline picks passthrough when a
  provider already emits the wire codec — zero resample, zero re-encode. Opt-in
  and backward compatible: adapters that declare nothing keep the legacy
  PCM16 @ 16 kHz path. `libraries/typescript/src/audio/format.ts` (new),
  `providers/cartesia-tts.ts`, `providers/openai-tts.ts`, `tts/cartesia.ts`.
  Python mirror: `getpatter/audio/format.py` (new), `providers/cartesia_tts.py`,
  `providers/openai_tts.py`, `tts/cartesia.py`.
- **Agent SKILLS — on-demand, progressive-disclosure capabilities the primary
  agent activates inline (no sub-agent spawn).** New `Skill` type and
  `agent(skills=[...])` (Python) / `phone.agent({ skills: [...] })` (TS). A
  `Skill` carries `name`, `description`, on-demand `instructions`, and optional
  scoped `tools`. At call start Patter injects a built-in `use_skill` tool whose
  `skill_name` is an *enum* of the skill names — only each skill's name +
  description (~30-50 tokens) is loaded eagerly (the Anthropic Agent Skills
  *discovery* layer), NOT the full instructions. When the model calls
  `use_skill(skill_name=…)` Patter layers that skill's `instructions` into the
  system prompt and unlocks its `tools` ADDITIVELY — in the SAME agent loop (one
  iteration, no extra round-trip, so no added latency vs. a real sub-agent). The
  skill stays active for the rest of the call; re-activation is idempotent, and
  a `handoff_to` resets the active set to the target agent's skills. Skill tool
  names are guarded against the reserved built-ins (`transfer_call`, `end_call`,
  `handoff_to`, `use_skill`), top-level agent tools, and other skills at
  `agent()` build time. Works in both Realtime (`session.update`) and Pipeline
  (`update_agent`) modes. Opt-in; default empty — zero behaviour change for
  existing agents. `Skill` is exported from the package root.
  `libraries/python/getpatter/models.py` (`Skill`, `Agent.skills`),
  `tools/skills.py` (new), `stream_handler.py`, `client.py`, `__init__.py`.
  TypeScript mirror: `libraries/typescript/src/types.ts` (`Skill`,
  `AgentOptions.skills`), `skills.ts` (new), `stream-handler.ts`, `server.ts`,
  `client.ts`, `index.ts`.

- **Pipeline mode: prompt token-counting + opt-in token-aware history
  compaction.** The built-in LLM loop now estimates the assembled prompt size
  (system + rolling summary + history + user, in the canonical `chars / 4`
  token unit) before every dispatch and records it as a new `context_tokens`
  field on `CallMetrics` (peak across the call) — so dashboards can chart
  context growth. A new optional `contextTokenBudget` / `context_token_budget`
  on the agent makes the loop log a one-shot WARNING when a turn's estimated
  context crosses ~75% of the budget, an early signal before a model's hard
  context limit triggers a silent `context_length_exceeded`. Built on top of
  that, a new optional `compaction` config (`CompactionConfig` with
  `triggerTokens` / `targetTokens` / `keepLastTurns`) enables a hybrid rolling
  summarizer: once the summarizable portion of the history crosses
  `triggerTokens`, the oldest turns are folded into a summary **asynchronously
  in the background** (using the agent's own LLM, so no turn latency is added)
  while the most recent `keepLastTurns` turns stay verbatim; the summarized
  turns are pruned from the working history and the summary is prepended as a
  system message on subsequent prompts, keeping long calls bounded without
  losing facts stated early. The previously hard-coded 200-entry history ring
  is now tunable via `maxHistory` / `max_history`. All four knobs are opt-in
  with defaults that preserve today's behaviour exactly (no compaction, no
  warning, 200-entry ring). Pipeline mode only.
  TS: `libraries/typescript/src/compaction.ts` (new), `types.ts`, `llm-loop.ts`,
  `metrics.ts`, `stream-handler.ts`, `handler-utils.ts`,
  `observability/event-bus.ts`, `index.ts`. Python mirror:
  `libraries/python/getpatter/services/compaction.py` (new), `models.py`,
  `services/llm_loop.py`, `services/metrics.py`, `stream_handler.py`,
  `client.py`, `telephony/twilio.py`, `telephony/plivo.py`, `__init__.py`.
- **OpenAI Realtime: `transcriptionLanguage` option on both engine markers.**
  `OpenAIRealtime` / `OpenAIRealtime2` (TS) and `engines.openai_realtime` /
  `engines.openai_realtime_2` (Python) now accept an optional ISO-639-1
  `transcriptionLanguage` (`transcription_language` in Python) that pins the
  Realtime session's `input_audio_transcription.language` instead of letting
  Whisper auto-detect per utterance. Auto-detect mislabels short / noisy phone
  utterances (an Italian "sì" comes back tagged Spanish or English), which only
  corrupted the display-side transcript (dashboard / `onTranscript` / history) —
  the speech-to-speech model's comprehension was never affected. Optional,
  omitted by default (auto-detect preserved, no behaviour change for existing
  callers). `libraries/typescript/src/engines/openai.ts`, `engines/openai-2.ts`,
  `providers/openai-realtime.ts`, `providers/openai-realtime-2.ts`, `server.ts`.

### Changed

- **AEC scope documented: browser/native only, no-op by design on PSTN.** The
  NLMS echo canceller (`audio/aec.py` / `audio/aec.ts`) docstrings now state
  explicitly that on a phone call the carrier round-trip exceeds the 32 ms
  filter window, so `process_near_end` / `processNearEnd` passes through
  unchanged — PSTN line echo is handled by the carrier (ITU-T G.168) and the
  caller device. The existing runtime warning when `echo_cancellation` is
  enabled on a PSTN carrier is unchanged. No behaviour change.

### Fixed

- **(TypeScript) Pipeline self-interrupted the user-turn LLM (false barge-in →
  agent went mute after its opening line).** Two structural defects combined:
  (1) `beginSpeaking()` armed barge-in at LLM *dispatch* time
  (`firstAudioSentAt` stamped before any audio existed), so a slow-first-token
  turn became "interruptible" ~500 ms later while the caller had heard nothing;
  (2) `handleBargeIn` ran before the STT duplicate/hallucination filter, so a
  lagging Deepgram `speech_final` twin of an already-committed `is_final`
  aborted the still-producing turn. Now `firstAudioSentAt` is set only by the
  real outbound-audio path (`markFirstAudioSent`, after `bridge.sendAudio`), so
  `canBargeIn()` stays false until the agent truly emits audio; and a read-only
  duplicate check (mirroring `commitTranscript`'s filters without consuming
  dedup state) gates both barge-in paths. Genuine barge-in (agent audibly
  speaking + new caller speech) still aborts + re-dispatches; the AEC 1000 ms
  window and `bargeInThresholdMs`/autoVad branches are unchanged.
  `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts`.

- **Chipmunk / aliasing on pipeline TTS at non-16 kHz rates.** The outbound
  sender assumed every TTS source was PCM16 @ 16 kHz and ran a hardcoded
  16 kHz → 8 kHz decimator before μ-law encoding. A provider configured for any
  other rate (e.g. `CartesiaTTS({ sampleRate: 8000 })` on Twilio) was decimated
  *again* and played back at ~2× pitch ("chipmunk"); the 16 kHz default left an
  aliasing hiss from the gentle 5-tap decimator. The sender now reads the
  provider's **declared** output rate and resamples from the real rate to the
  carrier's 8 kHz wire — correct pitch and duration for 8 k / 16 k / 22.05 k /
  24 k / 44.1 k sources, with an anti-alias FIR low-pass on the downsample
  (< ~1 ms added latency). `CartesiaTTS.forTwilio()` / `forTelnyx()` now emit
  μ-law 8 kHz natively (bit-clean passthrough) instead of the broken fixed-rate
  workaround. `libraries/typescript/src/audio/transcoding.ts` (new
  `RateAwareResampler`), `stream-handler.ts` (`configureOutboundAudio`).
  Python mirror: `getpatter/stream_handler.py` (`PipelineStreamHandler.start`),
  `telephony/{twilio,telnyx,plivo}.py` (new `AudioSender.set_source_format`).
- **Pipeline LLM loop (TypeScript): malformed tool-argument JSON no longer
  fires the tool with empty arguments.** When the model streamed truncated /
  invalid JSON for a tool call, the TS loop parsed it as `{}` and executed the
  handler anyway — a side-effecting tool (transfer, SMS, booking) could fire on
  an empty payload. It now matches the Python loop: the malformed call is logged
  and answered with a `role=tool` error envelope (preserving the
  `tool_call_id`), the handler is skipped, and the model retries with
  well-formed arguments. `libraries/typescript/src/llm-loop.ts`.

- **OpenAI Realtime 2: raspy / crackly agent voice on telephony.** The GA
  adapter decimated `gpt-realtime-2`'s 24 kHz output down to mulaw 8 kHz through
  a 24→16 (linear, unfiltered) → 16→8 (gentle 5-tap binomial) chain that
  under-attenuated energy above 4 kHz. `gpt-realtime-2` emits significant
  high-frequency content, which aliased into the telephony band and was heard as
  raspy speech. A 63-tap Hamming-windowed-sinc anti-alias low-pass (cutoff
  3.7 kHz, ~53 dB stopband, stateful across audio deltas) now runs on the 24 kHz
  signal before decimation, so the downstream stages have nothing above the
  cutoff left to fold back. Contained to the Realtime-2 outbound path — the
  shared `StatefulResampler` / pipeline TTS is untouched.
  `libraries/typescript/src/audio/transcoding.ts` (new `StatefulFirLowpass`),
  `providers/openai-realtime-2.ts`. Python mirror:
  `libraries/python/getpatter/audio/transcoding.py` (`StatefulFirLowpass`),
  `providers/openai_realtime_2.py`.

### Security

- **SSRF guard now folds non-canonical IP encodings.** The outbound-URL guards
  (tool webhooks, `on_message`, `consult`, MCP) recognised only canonical IP
  literals, so alternate spellings of an internal address that `getaddrinfo` /
  the WHATWG URL parser accept slipped past the private-range checks and
  connected to the blocked host — including `169.254.169.254` cloud-metadata
  (IAM-credential theft). Now every spelling is normalised before the range
  check: decimal / octal / hex / short IPv4 (`http://2130706433/`,
  `0x7f.0.0.1`, `0177.0.0.1`, `127.1`) and IPv4-mapped IPv6
  (`[::ffff:169.254.169.254]`, incl. Node's canonical `::ffff:a9fe:a9fe` hex
  form). A mapped *public* address (`::ffff:8.8.8.8`) stays allowed. Python adds
  a shared `getpatter/ssrf.py` (`resolve_literal_ip` via `socket.inet_aton` +
  `is_internal_ip` unwrapping `ipv4_mapped`) used by both
  `tools/tool_executor.py::_validate_webhook_url` and the
  `server.py::validate_webhook_url` mirror, closing the drift between them; TS
  unwraps IPv4-mapped IPv6 in `src/server.ts::validateWebhookUrl`. Reported via
  responsible disclosure (#195). The guard remains best-effort against
  DNS-rebinding by design (hostnames resolve at request time) — webhook URLs are
  trusted SDK-user config, not caller-supplied.

- **Hardening sweep from a follow-up audit — six parity-drift fixes (a guard
  present in one SDK but missing/weaker in the other).**
  - *(TypeScript) Outbound fetches now fail closed on redirects (`redirect: 'error'`).*
    Every guarded `fetch()` (tool webhook, `on_message`, `consult`, MCP) followed
    3xx by default, so an attacker-influenced `302 Location: 169.254.169.254`
    bypassed the SSRF guard (which validated only the first hop) — reaching
    cloud-metadata / internal services. Python was never affected (httpx
    `follow_redirects=False`). `llm-loop.ts`, `handler-utils.ts`, `consult.ts`,
    `remote-message.ts`.
  - *(TypeScript) Caller DTMF is no longer logged.* Two Telnyx paths logged the
    raw keypad digit at INFO (`server.ts`); callers enter PINs / card numbers /
    SSNs via DTMF precisely so they are not transcribed. Now dropped to DEBUG with
    no value, matching Python.
  - *Call-id path traversal closed (both SDKs).* The on-disk call-id path segment
    (recording / call-log dir) stripped only POSIX `/`, letting a forged carrier
    call id with `\` or `..` escape the directory on Windows. New shared
    `safe_path_segment` / `safePathSegment` folds every separator and neutralises
    `..`. `utils/log_sanitize.py`, `stream-handler.ts`, `services/call_log.py`,
    `services/call-log.ts`, `server.py`, `server.ts`.
  - *Tool/consult response size cap now enforced during the read.* The 1 MB cap
    was applied after the whole body was buffered (illusory OOM guard). Python
    streams + bounds the read (`tool_executor.py`, `consult.py`); TS rejects an
    oversized `Content-Length` up front, with the existing per-request timeout as
    the chunked-body backstop.
  - *(TypeScript) Transfer-destination phone numbers are masked in logs* (last-4
    only, parity with Python). `server.ts`, `telephony/plivo.ts`.
  - *Variable sanitiser now strips Unicode line separators* (U+0085, U+2028,
    U+2029), not just ASCII `\n`/`\r`, closing a line-break prompt-injection gap
    in interpolated carrier custom params (both SDKs). `telephony/common.py`,
    `server.ts`.
  - Plus a consistency fix: the Python `on_message` WebSocket guard now routes
    through the shared `getpatter/ssrf.py` so it folds non-canonical IP spellings
    like its HTTP sibling.

## 0.6.9 (2026-06-23)

### Added

- **`getpatter init` — greenfield project setup wizard, plus the
  `npm create getpatter` launcher.** A new interactive scaffolder generates a
  complete, runnable inbound voice-agent project so a new user goes from nothing
  to a project they can run in under a minute. It prompts for a voice mode
  (`realtime` — one engine — or `pipeline` — STT + LLM + TTS), the
  engine/providers, and the telephony carrier, then writes the entry file
  (`main.py` / `src/index.ts`), a `.env` (chmod 0600 — secrets are never echoed
  or logged) and `.env.example`, the dependency manifest, `.gitignore`, and a
  `README.md`. Every prompt has a matching flag (`--mode`, `--engine`, `--stt`,
  `--llm`, `--tts`, `--carrier`, `--yes`, …) so it also runs fully
  non-interactively in CI. Exposed as `getpatter init` on both CLIs
  (`libraries/python/getpatter/init/`, `libraries/typescript/src/init/cli.ts`)
  and as `npm create getpatter` via the new zero-dependency `create-getpatter`
  launcher package, which re-dispatches to the same wizard (single source of
  truth — no bundled copy). Additive: no existing command or public API
  changes. Python ↔ TypeScript parity (byte-for-byte mirrored prompts, flags,
  defaults, and scaffold codegen). Docs: `docs/quickstart-create.mdx`.

- **Python: `KrispVivaFilter` and `DeepFilterNetFilter` are now exported from
  the package root.** Both noise-suppression `AudioFilter` implementations
  already shipped as modules (`getpatter/providers/krisp_filter.py`,
  `getpatter/providers/deepfilternet_filter.py`) but were not surfaced on the
  `getpatter` barrel, so Python users had to reach into the internal provider
  path while TypeScript already exported the equivalent `KrispVivaFilter` /
  `DeepFilterNetFilter` classes. They are now resolvable as
  `getpatter.KrispVivaFilter` / `getpatter.DeepFilterNetFilter` and listed in
  `__all__`. Resolution is lazy (via `getpatter.__getattr__`, matching
  `SileroVAD` / `SmartTurnDetector`) so importing `getpatter` still costs
  nothing when the proprietary `krisp-audio` SDK or the heavy `deepfilternet`
  (torch) extra is absent. Additive, backward-compatible, and closes a
  Python↔TypeScript public-surface parity gap. `libraries/python/getpatter/__init__.py`.

- **Telemetry: `config_incomplete` — activation-blocker signal.** A new event
  emitted at most once per `Patter` instance when required runtime config is
  missing so the instance/agent cannot proceed. It carries a single coarse enum
  dimension `missing` (`carrier_credentials` / `llm_key` / `engine_config` /
  `other`) naming *what* is absent — never the key value, env var name, carrier
  credentials, or any PII. Emitted immediately before the existing validation
  error at each blocker site: a carrier with no phone number (and, in TypeScript,
  a missing `phoneNumber` / `carrier`) → `carrier_credentials`; OpenAI Realtime
  mode with no API key → `llm_key`; an incomplete pipeline/engine config (Python
  pipeline with no STT; TypeScript unknown-engine and invalid-provider) →
  `engine_config`. Fire-and-forget: it can never throw into, block, or alter the
  call/control flow — the original error propagates unchanged. In the
  never-sampled set, so it is always delivered when telemetry is enabled and
  emits nothing on opt-out. `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/client.ts`. Parity across both SDKs.

- **`PATTER_TELEMETRY_SAMPLE` — client-side downsampling of high-frequency call
  telemetry.** New env var, a float in `[0, 1]` read once at telemetry-client
  construction (Python `getpatter/telemetry/env.py` `sample_rate()` /
  `getpatter/telemetry/client.py`; TypeScript `src/telemetry/env.ts`
  `sampleRate()` / `src/telemetry/client.ts`). Defaults to `1.0` (no sampling —
  every event kept); a missing, empty, non-numeric, `< 0`, or `> 1` value fails
  safe back to `1.0` and never raises, so a misconfigured env can never silently
  drop data. The gate applies ONLY to the high-frequency `call_started` /
  `call_completed` events; `first_run`, `config_incomplete`, `sdk_initialized`,
  `cli_command`, `feature_used`, `agent_configured`, and any error
  `call_completed` (`outcome == "error"` or an `error_code` present) are always
  delivered regardless of rate. The keep/drop decision is **deterministic per
  run** — derived from a SHA-256 hash of the per-process `run_id` — so a whole
  run consistently keeps or drops its sampleable call events rather than flipping
  a per-event coin (which would bias short runs). When a sampled call event is
  kept at a rate `< 1.0`, the event carries a `sample_rate` dimension so
  analytics can extrapolate true volume with weight `1 / sample_rate`; at rate
  `1.0` no `sample_rate` is stamped (payloads stay lean). Lets future
  high-volume installs cut telemetry egress without losing extrapolation
  accuracy. Opt-in, additive, parity across both SDKs.

- **Telemetry: per-stage latency on `call_completed`.** The existing
  `call_completed` event now carries up to four whole-millisecond latency dims
  read straight off the per-call metrics accumulator (`CallMetrics.latency_p95`,
  the same source as `latency_ms`): `stt_latency_ms` (`LatencyBreakdown.stt_ms`),
  `llm_ttft_ms` (`llm_ttft_ms`), `tts_first_byte_ms` (`tts_ms`), and
  `eou_latency_ms` (`endpoint_ms`). Read-only — no new audio-path
  instrumentation. A dim is omitted (never sent as `0`) when its stage didn't
  run, so realtime/convai engines naturally drop `stt_latency_ms` /
  `tts_first_byte_ms`. `libraries/python/getpatter/telemetry/call_metrics.py`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/telemetry/call-metrics.ts`.

- **Telemetry: `error_layer` + `disconnect_reason` on `call_completed`.**
  `error_layer` (`stt`/`llm`/`tts`/`carrier`/`config`/`internal`/`none`/`other`)
  is derived deterministically from the existing `CallMetrics.error_code` (never
  the message); `none` on a clean completion. `disconnect_reason`
  (`error`/`timeout`/`no_answer`/`busy`/`completed`/`other`) is derived from the
  terminal outcome plus the error code. These populate the previously
  under-filled error taxonomy from state already known at call end.
  `libraries/python/getpatter/telemetry/call_metrics.py`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/telemetry/call-metrics.ts`.

- **Telemetry: `time_to_first_call_bucket` on `call_started` and
  `call_completed`.** A coarse activation-funnel band
  (`lt_1h`/`1h_1d`/`1d_7d`/`gt_7d`/`unknown`) computed from the install-id file
  mtime via a new public `install_age_seconds()` / `installAgeSeconds()` helper
  (`getpatter/telemetry/install_id.py` / `src/telemetry/install-id.ts`), reusing
  the same mtime seam as `days_since_install_bucket`. Read-only and best-effort —
  `unknown` on a read-only / unreadable filesystem.

- **Opt-in `client_state` / `clientState` on the programmatic transfer
  surface (Telnyx).** `CallControl.transfer(number, client_state="…")` (Python)
  and `bridge.transferCall(callId, number, { clientState: "…" })` (TypeScript)
  now forward an opaque context string that Telnyx base64-encodes and echoes on
  the transferred leg's subsequent webhooks — so call context can survive a
  handoff. Previously the underlying `_telnyx_transfer` / `TelnyxBridge`
  capability was unreachable (no public option fed it). Optional with no
  default → the cold-transfer request body stays byte-identical for callers
  that don't set it, and carriers without the capability (Twilio/Plivo) ignore
  it. The LLM `transfer_call` tool schema is unchanged (an opaque state string
  is a developer concern, not an LLM one). `libraries/python/getpatter/models.py`
  (`CallControl.transfer`, `_invoke_transfer_fn`);
  `libraries/typescript/src/types.ts` (`TransferCallOptions`),
  `libraries/typescript/src/server.ts` (`TelnyxBridge.transferCall`).

### Changed

- **Telemetry `SCHEMA_VERSION` bumped 7 → 8** for the new `config_incomplete`
  event, the per-stage latency / `error_layer` / `disconnect_reason` /
  `time_to_first_call_bucket` dimensions, and the `sample_rate` dimension added
  by client-side sampling. The relay applies version-appropriate validation off
  this number, so it moves in lockstep across both SDKs
  (`libraries/python/getpatter/telemetry/events.py`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/telemetry/events.ts`). No payload a v7 consumer
  understood was removed or renamed — all changes are additive.

### Fixed

- **Telemetry: `call_completed` now carries the call `direction`
  (inbound/outbound).** The media-stream bridge's end payload has no direction,
  and the call-end handler — unlike the call-start handler — never resolved it
  from the active dashboard-store record, so every `call_completed` event was
  emitted with `direction` omitted while `call_started` carried it. This made the
  inbound/outbound funnel impossible to close in the usage analytics (the field
  was empty on 100% of completions). Both SDKs now resolve `direction` from the
  active store record (seeded with the true inbound/outbound at dial/connect
  time) before recording the completion, mirroring the start path.
  `libraries/python/getpatter/server.py` (`_on_call_end`),
  `libraries/typescript/src/server.ts` (`wrappedEnd`). Resolution depends on the
  dashboard store, which is present by default; behaviour is unchanged when the
  store is disabled (the start side has the same dependency). Parity across both
  SDKs.

- **Plivo `extra_headers` are now exposed to the agent prompt and
  `on_call_start` (parity with Twilio's `<Parameter>` customParameters).**
  Developer-supplied headers delivered on the Plivo `start` frame were parsed
  only for caller/callee recovery and otherwise dropped — `resolve_agent_prompt`
  and the `on_call_start` callback both received an empty `custom_params`, so
  `{placeholder}` template variables sourced from inbound metadata never
  resolved on Plivo calls. They are now parsed unconditionally and forwarded as
  `custom_params` (internal `X-PH-caller`/`X-PH-callee` markers re-exposed as
  `caller`/`callee`). The TypeScript Plivo bridge never read `extra_headers` at
  all; it now passes the same `customParams` into `handleCallStart`.
  `libraries/python/getpatter/telephony/plivo.py`;
  `libraries/typescript/src/providers/plivo-adapter.ts` (new
  `parsePlivoExtraHeaders` / `plivoInboundCustomParams`),
  `libraries/typescript/src/server.ts`.

## 0.6.8 (2026-06-13)

### Added

- **TypeScript: `EvalSession` — the eval harness now has full parity with
  Python.** `import { EvalSession, expect, ScriptedLLMProvider } from
  "getpatter"` constructs a REAL pipeline-mode `StreamHandler` and injects user
  turns through the live-call path (transcript commit → dispatch → `LLMLoop` →
  tool executor → sentence chunker → TTS), faking only the paid/external
  boundary (`FakeAudioSender`/`FakeSTT`/`FakeTTS` + a deterministic
  `ScriptedLLMProvider` or any real `LLMProvider`). `await session.userSays("…")`
  returns a readonly `TurnResult` (`agentText`, `toolCalls`, `historySnapshot`,
  `interrupted`, `metricsTurn`); `expect(result)` adds chainable
  `.toolCalled(name, argsSubset?)` / `.noToolCalled()` / `.agentTextContains(…)`
  plus async `.judge(llmJudge, { intent })`. `EvalCase` gains optional
  `agent`/`llmProvider` routing through the session (the legacy reply-factory
  path is unchanged), and `getpatter eval run <suite>` replaces the CLI stub
  (exit codes 0/1/2, JSON report, `--agent module:export` loader). Defaults and
  report rows are byte-compatible with Python's. New
  `libraries/typescript/src/evals/`; `src/cli.ts`, `src/index.ts`.

- **Python: `barge_in_mode` / `barge_in_confirm_ms` are now `Patter.agent()`
  keywords** (TypeScript parity — `AgentOptions` already exposed `bargeInMode` /
  `bargeInConfirmMs`). Previously they existed only as `Agent` dataclass fields,
  forcing callers through `dataclasses.replace(...)` on the returned agent.
  Same defaults (`"cancel"` / `1500`); invalid modes are rejected with a
  `ValueError`. Opt-in — existing calls are unaffected.
  `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py`.

- **Telemetry: `call_uid` — a random per-call correlation id (schema v7).**
  `call_started` and `call_completed` of the same call now carry the same
  SDK-generated random id (`uuid4().hex`), so the call lifecycle can be
  followed across its telemetry events (connect→complete pairing, per-call
  funnel integrity, retry analysis). It is **never the carrier call SID** and
  cannot be linked to phone numbers or call content; the hex32 shape is
  enforced client-side and re-checked by the relay (off-shape values are
  dropped, never coerced). A call that never connects (`no_answer`/`busy`/
  `failed`) carries a `call_uid` on its lone `call_completed` event.
  `libraries/python/getpatter/telemetry/events.py`,
  `libraries/python/getpatter/telemetry/call_metrics.py`,
  `libraries/python/getpatter/server.py`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/telemetry/events.ts`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/telemetry/call-metrics.ts`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/server.ts`, `docs/telemetry.mdx`.

### Fixed

- **Telemetry: `call_completed` is no longer lost when the process exits right
  after `disconnect()`.** Found live in an E2E call test: `call_started`
  reached the collector but `call_completed` — the one event carrying
  duration/cost/latency/outcome — never did, for every short-lived script
  ("place call, wait, exit", the main outbound use case). `disconnect()` used
  a fire-and-forget flush; the loop closed right after and cancelled the POST
  mid-air, and Python's 0.25 s atexit fallback was too short for a cold TLS
  handshake. Both SDKs now `await telemetry.drain()` in `disconnect()` — a
  new bounded flush-and-wait that keeps the client reusable (a subsequent
  `serve()` still emits) — and the Python atexit timeout is bumped to 1 s as
  a second line of defense for scripts that never call `disconnect()`.
  `libraries/python/getpatter/telemetry/client.py`,
  `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/telemetry/client.ts`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/client.ts`.

- **Telemetry: `hermes` / `openclaw` CLI usage is no longer invisible (schema
  v6).** The `cli_command` enum was closed over
  `dashboard/eval/telemetry/none/other`, so the wizard commands — the main
  growth surface — collapsed to `other` (Python) or were never emitted at all
  (TypeScript's `cli.ts` dispatched `hermes`/`openclaw` without recording the
  event, diverging from Python which records every command). Both SDKs now
  carry `hermes` and `openclaw` as first-class enum values (byte-identical
  sets, `SCHEMA_VERSION` 5 → 6) and the TypeScript CLI emits for both commands.
  Until the relay allowlist ships the same values, they coerce to `other`
  server-side — safe, no breakage.
  `libraries/python/getpatter/telemetry/events.py`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/telemetry/events.ts`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/cli.ts`.

- **`provider="openai_realtime"` now honours `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the
  environment — and the env key actually reaches the call path.** Python's
  validation rejected the provider-string path unless the key was on the
  config, even though its own error message promised "or set OPENAI_API_KEY in
  the environment" (the engine markers already env-fallback). TypeScript
  accepted the env var at validation but then dialed with an empty
  `localConfig.openaiKey` — a dead call at connect time instead of a clear
  error. Both SDKs now backfill the local config from the environment when the
  provider-string path has no configured key, and reject with the same message
  when no key exists anywhere. Caught by running the cross-SDK parity suite
  with `OPENAI_API_KEY` set. `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/client.ts`.
- **Python: an explicit `voice=` / `model=` on `agent()` now always wins over
  the `engine=` marker — even when the value equals the documented default.**
  The kwargs moved to sentinel defaults (`voice: str | None = None`,
  `model: str | None = None`) so "explicit `gpt-realtime-mini`" is
  distinguishable from "unset": previously
  `agent(model="gpt-realtime-mini", engine=OpenAIRealtime(model="gpt-realtime-2"))`
  silently ran (and reported in telemetry) the engine's model, while the same
  call in TypeScript ran the explicit one. Resolution is now
  explicit → engine → default in both SDKs (TS was already correct). Calls
  that omit `voice=`/`model=` see zero change.
  `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py`.
- **Telemetry (TypeScript): a flush completing after `close()` began no longer
  chains a detached delivery.** The post-flush chain in
  `libraries/typescript/src/telemetry/client.ts` now stops once `close()` has
  started (parity with Python's `not self._closed` guard): without it, an event
  recorded during an in-flight POST could be picked up by a chained flush that
  `close()` never awaited — a prompt process exit then killed that POST mid-air.
  `close()` now always drains later-buffered events itself before resolving.
  Added the previously missing regression tests (both SDKs) for the
  "event recorded during an in-flight flush is chained, not stranded" 0.6.7 fix.
- **Telemetry: large flushes are no longer truncated by the collector.** The
  client buffers up to 256 events but the collector accepts at most 64 per
  request — a busy session's flush could silently lose everything past the cap
  (or the whole batch when oversized). Both SDKs now ship flushes in chunks of
  ≤64 events per POST, on the async path and the exit-flush path.
  `libraries/python/getpatter/telemetry/client.py`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/telemetry/client.ts`.
- **Telemetry: state files respect the XDG spec, and a persisted opt-out
  survives environment changes.** With `XDG_STATE_HOME` set, the state files
  (`install-id`, `version`, `first-run`, `telemetry-disabled`) were written into
  the bare XDG root instead of an app subdirectory — colliding with other tools
  and, worse, making a `getpatter telemetry disable` opt-out persisted under
  `~/.getpatter/` go unhonored when the process later ran with XDG set (and vice
  versa). Files now live in `$XDG_STATE_HOME/getpatter/`; a pre-existing legacy
  id is migrated (no double-counted installs, mtime preserved for the install-age
  bucket), a legacy opt-out marker keeps disabling telemetry, and a legacy
  first-run marker is never re-emitted.
  `libraries/python/getpatter/telemetry/install_id.py`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/telemetry/install-id.ts`.
- **Telemetry: the first-use disclosure is actually visible in Python.** The
  one-time "anonymous telemetry is on" notice was emitted via `logging` at INFO
  level, but the SDK attaches no handler — Python's last-resort handler only
  shows WARNING and above, so a default install never saw the opt-out notice
  (TypeScript already printed it via its console-backed logger). Python now
  writes the disclosure straight to stderr, once per process, matching the
  TypeScript behaviour and the OSS norm (Next.js/Astro).
  `libraries/python/getpatter/telemetry/client.py`.

## 0.6.7 (2026-06-10)

### Fixed

- **Telemetry: fire-and-forget events no longer vanish before delivery.** Three
  delivery bugs found by end-to-end testing of the published 0.6.6 packages, fixed
  in both SDKs: (1) a `TelemetryClient` constructed without holding a reference —
  the CLI's `cli_command` pattern — was garbage-collected together with its buffered
  events before the exit flush could send them (the registry is a weak set by
  design; clients now hold a strong module-level reference from first buffered
  event until the buffer drains); (2) `aclose()`/`close()` flushed an already-empty
  buffer while the delivery POST started by `record(...)` was still in flight, so a
  prompt shutdown killed it mid-air (close now awaits the in-flight flush first);
  (3) events recorded *while* a flush POST was in flight stranded in the buffer with
  no flush scheduled (a completed flush now chains another when the buffer is
  non-empty). Net effect: `getpatter <command>` CLI usage events actually arrive, and
  constructor-time events (`sdk_initialized`, `first_run`) can no longer shadow
  agent-time events. `libraries/python/getpatter/telemetry/client.py`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/telemetry/client.ts`.

### Added

- **Telemetry: Realtime model variant in `feature_used`.** Realtime agents now
  report which Realtime model they run (`llm_model: "openai-gpt-realtime-2"`,
  `"openai-gpt-realtime-mini"`, …) through the existing sanitized `llm_model`
  dimension (custom/fine-tuned names still collapse to `openai-other`), so model mix
  is visible for the realtime engine family the way it already was for pipeline
  stacks. The per-process dedupe key includes the model, so two agents on different
  Realtime models both record. `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/client.ts`.

## 0.6.6 (2026-06-10)

### Added

- **Warm transfer — `transfer_call(mode="warm", summary=...)` / `transferCall(..., { mode: 'warm', summary })`.** The built-in `transfer_call` tool (and the programmatic `CallControl.transfer` / `TelephonyBridge.transferCall` surfaces) now accept an optional carrier-neutral `mode` (`"cold"` default — byte-identical to the historical blind redirect — or `"warm"`) plus a `summary`. Warm mode parks the caller in a per-call conference on hold music, dials the human agent with the summary spoken first (`<Say>`), then bridges the two as the AI leg ends — implemented on **Twilio** (conference + REST sequence, with `/webhooks/twilio/conference` lifecycle observability and a `/webhooks/twilio/warm-status` callback that gracefully releases a caller stuck on hold when the human never answers, both signature-validated fail-closed); **Telnyx and Plivo return a clear `{error}` envelope** (logged warning, AI keeps the call) instead of silently degrading to a blind redirect. Invalid modes are rejected with an error envelope on every path. Opt-in — agents that never pass `mode` see zero behavior change. `libraries/python/getpatter/{models,server,stream_handler}.py`, `.../telephony/{twilio,telnyx,plivo}.py`, `.../providers/twilio_adapter.py` + TypeScript mirrors (`src/server.ts`, `src/telephony/plivo.ts`, `src/providers/twilio-adapter.ts`, `src/stream-handler.ts`, new `TransferCallOptions` / `TransferCallResult` types); `docs/{python,typescript}-sdk/tools.mdx`.
- **Multi-agent handoff — `agent(handoffs={...})` / `agent({ handoffs })` + built-in `handoff_to` tool.** Configure a named registry of target agents and Patter injects a `handoff_to(name, reason?)` tool (names schema-constrained via `enum`); calling it switches the LIVE call to the target agent's system prompt, tools, variables, guardrails, text transforms, consult tool, and onward `handoffs`, with conversation history preserved and a `[handoff]` system line recorded in the transcript (system entries are never replayed as fabricated user turns). Pipeline mode swaps the LLM loop's prompt + tool list for the next turn (`LLMLoop.update_agent` / `updateAgent`); Realtime mode applies a mid-session partial `session.update` (new `update_session` / `updateSession` on both the v1-beta and GA adapters, GA carrying the mandatory `"type": "realtime"` discriminator) **before** the function result so the model's next response already runs as the target agent. Unknown targets / malformed arguments return an error envelope to the model — never silence. Audio infrastructure established at call start (STT/TTS/engine connection — and therefore voice on engines that cannot switch voice mid-session) is retained; chained handoffs follow the target's own map. Off by default (`None` / `undefined` — no tool injected, zero behavior change). `libraries/python/getpatter/{client,models,stream_handler}.py`, `.../services/llm_loop.py`, `.../providers/openai_realtime{,_2}.py` + TypeScript mirrors (`src/{client,llm-loop,server,stream-handler,types,metrics,index}.ts`, `src/providers/openai-realtime{,-2}.ts`); `docs/{python,typescript}-sdk/tools.mdx`.
- **`local_recording` / `localRecording` — carrier-neutral local call recording.** `phone.serve(agent, local_recording=True)` (Python) / `serve({ localRecording: true })` (TypeScript) records every call **inside the SDK itself**, from the media stream it already proxies — no carrier recording API, no per-minute recording fees, audio never leaves your machine. Works identically on Twilio, Telnyx and Plivo and in every engine mode (pipeline, OpenAI Realtime, ElevenLabs ConvAI). Output is the QA-industry-standard **stereo WAV with one direction per channel** — left = caller, right = agent — 16-bit PCM at 16 kHz (μ-law 8 kHz wire audio is decoded + upsampled; Realtime 24 kHz output is downsampled). Alignment is caller-clocked: the inbound PSTN frame stream is the wall clock, agent TTS bursts drain at that rate (mirroring the carrier playout buffer) and the idle channel is zero-padded. The WAV is written incrementally with buffered I/O (64 KiB batches — no per-frame disk writes, bounded memory) and the header is finalized on **every** teardown path, including abnormal carrier WebSocket drops, so a truncated call still yields a playable file. The file lands next to `metadata.json` / `transcript.jsonl` in the per-call log directory when call logging is enabled (so `PATTER_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` sweeps recordings too) and the final path is surfaced as `recording_path` in the `on_call_end` / `onCallEnd` payload and in `metadata.json`; pass a directory string instead of `True` to choose where WAVs go (`./recordings/<call_id>.wav` is the no-call-logging fallback). Off by default; independent of the existing carrier-side `recording` flag (both can be on). New `libraries/python/getpatter/audio/call_recorder.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/audio/call-recorder.ts` (public `LocalCallRecorder`).
- **`EvalSession` — an eval harness that drives the REAL pipeline call loop (Python-only by design; the TypeScript CLI keeps its evals stub).** The existing eval runner scored an arbitrary `reply(text) -> str` callable and never touched the SDK; `getpatter.evals.session.EvalSession` instead constructs an actual `PipelineStreamHandler` and injects user turns through the same path a live call uses — the real STT receive loop (`_handle_barge_in` → `_commit_transcript` → `_dispatch_turn`), the real `LLMLoop` with the real `ToolExecutor`, pipeline hooks, guardrail replacement, dedup/hallucination filtering, history handling, and metrics — with only the paid/external boundary faked (`FakeAudioSender`, `FakeSTT`, `FakeTTS`, and either a deterministic `ScriptedLLMProvider` for CI or any real `LLMProvider` for live evals). `async with EvalSession(agent=..., llm_provider=...) as s: result = await s.user_says("...")` returns a frozen `TurnResult` (`agent_text` = what the caller heard post-guardrails/hooks, `tool_calls`, `history_snapshot`, `interrupted`, `metrics_turn`); `getpatter.evals.assertions.expect(result)` adds chainable `tool_called(name, args_subset=)` / `no_tool_called()` / `agent_text_contains(...)` plus an async `judge(llm_judge, intent=...)` that reuses the existing `LLMJudge`. `EvalCase` gains optional `agent=` / `llm_provider=` fields routed through the session by `EvalRunner` (the legacy `reply()` factory path is unchanged, and both flavours mix in one suite). New `libraries/python/getpatter/evals/session.py`, `.../evals/assertions.py`; extended `.../evals/case.py`, `.../evals/runner.py`, `.../evals/__init__.py` (lazy exports).
- **`CustomLLM` — the canonical "Custom LLM" provider for any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.** One generic provider (the same engine the `HermesLLM` / `OpenClawLLM` presets subclass) now ships under the name the voice-AI ecosystem uses for this pattern: `from getpatter import CustomLLM` / `from getpatter.llm import custom` (Python) and `import { CustomLLM, custom } from "getpatter"` (TypeScript). Works with agent runtimes (Hermes, OpenClaw), keyless local gateways (Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio), or any service implementing `/chat/completions` with SSE streaming + tool calls — barge-in cancellation, long-turn filler, spoken error fallback, and cost attribution included. As part of this, the `session_key_from="caller_hash"` / `sessionKeyFrom: "caller_hash"` per-caller memory selector was hoisted from the Hermes preset into the generic provider, so ANY header-scoped runtime can enable cross-call per-caller memory (`patter-caller-<hash>`, never the raw number); the Hermes preset now delegates to it (behaviour unchanged). New `libraries/python/getpatter/llm/custom.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/llm/custom.ts`; `docs/python-sdk/llm.mdx`, `docs/typescript-sdk/llm.mdx`.
- **`patter openclaw` — zero-config CLI for the OpenClaw voice shell (inbound receptionist + outbound dialer).** A new `patter openclaw {doctor|setup|test|call|agents|attach-number|numbers}` wizard mirrors `patter hermes`, adapted for OpenClaw's **multi-agent** gateway: `doctor` lists the agents the gateway serves and warns if you point the phone at the default/master agent, plus a day-1 **security** section (loopback bind, a strong `OPENCLAW_API_KEY`, a scoped agent, tool-policy + AI-disclosure/EU-residency reminders); `setup --mode {inbound|outbound|both} --agent <id>` scaffolds a runnable `openclaw-phone-agent` project and (with `--enable-openclaw`) flips `gateway.http.endpoints.chatCompletions.enabled=true` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (JSON5-tolerant, backed up first); `test` runs a real `/v1/chat/completions` turn; `call` places one outbound test call. One scoped agent powers both directions — `app.py` (`phone.serve`) answers inbound and `dialer.py` (a supervised `phone.call` loop) dials outbound 24/7 — and the new `examples/openclaw-phone-agent/` ships `deploy/` systemd + launchd units for always-on operation. Provider-agnostic CLI helpers were factored into `getpatter/_cli_common.py` (shared with `patter hermes`, no behaviour change). The TypeScript SDK exposes a `getpatter openclaw` stub pointing at the Python wizard; the `OpenClawLLM` runtime provider is already in both SDKs. New `libraries/python/getpatter/cli_openclaw.py`, `.../_openclaw_scaffold.py`, `.../_cli_common.py`; `libraries/typescript/src/cli.ts` stub; `docs/integrations/openclaw.mdx`.
- **TypeScript namespace exports for the agent-LLM presets.** `import { hermes, openclaw, openaiCompatible } from "getpatter"` now works alongside the existing `HermesLLM` / `OpenClawLLM` / `OpenAICompatibleLLM` named exports, so `new hermes.LLM()` mirrors Python's `from getpatter.llm import hermes; hermes.LLM()`. `libraries/typescript/src/index.ts`.
- **`session_key_factory` / `sessionKeyFactory` — per-call long-term memory scope from a caller hash.** `OpenAICompatibleLLM` (and `HermesLLM`) can derive the `X-Hermes-Session-Key` header per call from a `SessionContext` (`call_id` / `caller` / `callee` / `caller_hash`) instead of a static value, so an agent runtime can remember a caller across calls **without the raw phone number ever reaching the wire or the logs**. Shortcut `HermesLLM(session_key_from="caller_hash")` installs a default `patter-caller-<caller_hash>` factory (SHA-256, 16 hex chars). New public `SessionContext` + `hash_caller` / `hashCaller` helper. The factory takes precedence over the static `session_key`; a falsy return omits the header. The loop dispatch was generalised to thread `caller` / `callee` only to providers whose `stream()` declares them (or `**kwargs`), keeping built-in and minimal custom providers unchanged. `libraries/python/getpatter/models.py`, `.../llm/openai_compatible.py`, `.../llm/hermes.py`, `.../services/llm_loop.py` + TypeScript mirrors.
- **`long_turn_message` / `longTurnMessage` — opt-in spoken filler during a slow turn.** When an LLM turn takes longer than `long_turn_message_after_s` (default 4 s) and no audio has reached the caller yet, Patter speaks a short configurable line (e.g. "One moment, let me check.") instead of dead silence — useful for agent runtimes (Hermes / OpenClaw) that run tools mid-turn. Distinct from `llm_error_message` (which fires on error): this fires on **slowness**, once per turn, gated on emitted audio so it never double-speaks. `None` / unset = off (no behaviour change). `libraries/python/getpatter/models.py`, `.../stream_handler.py`, `.../client.py` + TypeScript mirrors.
- **Anonymous usage telemetry (opt-out, on by default).** Patter now sends a
  small, anonymous, fail-safe usage event when the SDK is initialised and when
  an engine family is first used, so the maintainers can see which engines,
  providers, models, carriers, platforms, and SDK versions are in use — plus
  coarse per-call latency, duration, and cost — and prioritise accordingly.
  **No PII or call content is ever collected** — no phone numbers,
  transcripts, audio, prompts, tool arguments, API keys, customer identifiers,
  file paths, hostnames, or IPs; only coarse, low-cardinality facts (SDK version
  and language, OS family, CPU arch, runtime version bucketed to major.minor,
  and allowlisted dimensions like `engine`/`provider`/`carrier`). Two identifiers
  are sent, both random and PII-free: a per-process `run_id` (regenerated each
  run) and a persistent anonymous `install_id` — a random UUID stored locally
  (`~/.getpatter/install-id`) to count active installs, never a hardware
  fingerprint, never created when opted out. The collector drops the source IP.
  Telemetry is
  fire-and-forget with a bounded buffer, short timeouts, and swallow-all error
  handling, so it can never block, slow, or break a live call, and behaves
  identically when offline. It is **auto-disabled in CI and test runs**.
  Disable it with `Patter(telemetry=False)` / `new Patter({ telemetry: false })`,
  `PATTER_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1`, or the cross-tool `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`; point it at
  your own collector with `PATTER_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT`; and inspect exactly what
  would be sent without sending it via `PATTER_TELEMETRY_DEBUG=1`. New module
  `libraries/python/getpatter/telemetry/` and `libraries/typescript/src/telemetry/`;
  new optional `telemetry` field on `Patter(...)` / `LocalOptions`. Events:
  `sdk_initialized` (carrier, tunnel, plus presence-only anonymous deploy-shape —
  `invoked_by_agent` / `container` / `serverless` / `cloud` / `package_manager` /
  `days_since_install_bucket` / `previous_sdk_version` for the upgrade funnel),
  `feature_used` (engine + provider vendor
  family, plus — for **pipeline** agents — the composed stack: `stt_provider` /
  `tts_provider` / `llm_provider` and the sanitized `stt_model` / `tts_model` /
  `llm_model`, e.g. `deepgram-nova-3` / `anthropic-claude-opus-4-8`, where a
  fine-tuned / self-hosted / custom model collapses to `{vendor}-other` so a
  custom model name is never sent), `agent_configured` (built-in vs custom tool
  *counts* — never tool names — the coarse integration category: `openclaw` /
  `mcp` / `other` / hermes / none, and feature-adoption flags `noise_reduction` /
  `turn_detection` / `preambles_used` / `per_tool_timeouts_set` /
  `llm_fallback_configured`), and `call_completed` (one event per call with
  the terminal `outcome` — completed / error / no_answer / busy / failed — an
  `error_code` (a closed `ErrorCode` value such as `rate_limit` / `timeout` /
  `connection`, **never the error message**), the engine/provider/carrier, and the
  raw `latency_ms`, `duration_seconds`, total `cost_usd`, and `turn_count_bucket`;
  no call content and no per-call identifier). `CallMetrics` gains an `error_code` field and the
  metrics accumulator a `record_error()` / `recordError()` method. A
  second **value-level allowlist** coerces any off-list dimension value (e.g. a
  custom tool or integration name) to `other`, making customer brands
  structurally impossible to emit even from a buggy caller; the collector
  re-validates the same allowlist server-side.
- **Telemetry parity with OSS CLIs — CLI usage, activation, and a call funnel
  (schema v5).** Four more anonymous events round out the picture of how the SDK
  is actually used, matching how best-in-class OSS tools (Next.js, Astro,
  Homebrew) instrument themselves — still no PII, every field a coarse enum,
  bucket, or bool. New events: `cli_command` (which `getpatter` CLI command ran —
  the command *name* only, never arguments or flags; `dashboard` / `eval` /
  `telemetry` / `other`), `first_run` (sent **once per install**, on the run that
  creates the local state, to mark activation — carries the same anonymous
  deploy-shape dimensions as `sdk_initialized`, and is never sent when opted out),
  and `call_started` (emitted when a call connects, pairing with `call_completed`
  for a connect→complete funnel and a failure-rate denominator). A new
  `direction` dimension (inbound / outbound) is recorded on `call_started` and
  `call_completed` — a core usage split that was previously invisible. New
  **`getpatter telemetry status | disable | enable`** CLI command (parity with
  `next telemetry disable`) writes a persisted, machine-level opt-out marker
  (`~/.getpatter/telemetry-disabled`) honoured by the consent resolver; the
  control command itself never emits telemetry, so disabling never phones home.
  `libraries/python/getpatter/cli.py` / `telemetry/{events,consent,install_id,call_metrics}.py`
  and the TypeScript mirrors; both SDKs verified byte-for-byte at parity.

### Fixed

- **Pipeline mode: the greeting no longer blocks the carrier read-loop — callers can barge in on the first message.** Python's `PipelineStreamHandler.start()` synthesized and paced the whole `first_message` INLINE before entering the media loop, so for the entire greeting no inbound frame was read: VAD never ran, barge-in was impossible, and a long greeting delayed DTMF/stop handling. The greeting now runs as a tracked background task (`_first_message_task`, cancelled first in cleanup), mirroring the dispatch decoupling used for turns; TypeScript gained the same structure (`firstMessageTask`, settled in teardown). `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts`.
- **Concurrent calls no longer share one STT adapter instance.** `agent.stt` configured with a provider INSTANCE was handed as-is to every call, so two simultaneous calls fed one WebSocket/recognizer (interleaved audio, cross-call transcripts, double closes). Provider classes now capture their constructor args and expose `clone()`; the per-call setup clones the configured adapter (loud warn + shared fallback if cloning is impossible). `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/base.py`, `.../telephony/common.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/providers/*-stt.ts`, `.../src/provider-factory.ts`.
- **Dashboard SPA: live time window, ringing status, and deleted calls.** Three defects in the bundled dashboard: (a) the chart's time window was computed once at page load and never re-anchored, so after leaving the tab open the "last hour" silently became a stale frozen hour — the window now re-anchors on a 30 s tick and "All" uses an unbounded window; (b) `ringing`/`queued` carrier states rendered as "ended" — they are now a first-class `queued` live status; (c) a call deleted from the UI was resurrected by the next SSE snapshot — deletions (local and server-pushed `calls_deleted`) now feed a tombstone set consulted on every merge. Rebuilt `ui.html` shipped to BOTH SDKs. `dashboard-app/src/*`, `libraries/python/getpatter/dashboard/ui.html`, `libraries/typescript/src/dashboard/ui.html`.
- **`Patter(persist=...)` default unified: unset now persists to the platform data dir in BOTH SDKs.** The docs (and Python since 0.6.2) say call-history persistence is ON by default; TypeScript treated `undefined` as OFF, so the same app run from TS lost its dashboard history on every restart. `libraries/typescript/src/client.ts`.
- **`call(first_message=...)` is honoured again in both SDKs.** The per-call greeting override accepted by `call()` was dropped on the floor (the call ran with the agent-level greeting). It now overlays the agent for that call only. `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/client.ts`.
- **(TypeScript) `onCallStart` per-call agent overrides are applied (parity with Python).** Returning `{ system_prompt, voice, model, language, first_message, provider, tools, variables }` from `onCallStart` was documented cross-SDK but the TS server wrapper swallowed the return value; the stream handler now applies the snake_case override map before engine startup (`stt_config`/`tts_config` warn as unsupported, same as Python). `libraries/typescript/src/server.ts`, `.../src/stream-handler.ts`, `.../src/types.ts`.
- **ElevenLabs ConvAI: `client_tool_call` is finally handled — agent tools work on the ConvAI engine.** The ConvAI adapter ignored `client_tool_call` messages entirely, so any agent tool (and the `transfer_call` / `end_call` builtins) configured on a ConvAI agent silently never ran and the ConvAI session hung waiting for a result. Both SDKs now route the call to the builtin carrier helpers or the agent's tool executor and ALWAYS respond via `send_client_tool_result` (success or error envelope). `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/elevenlabs_convai.py`, `.../stream_handler.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/providers/elevenlabs-convai.ts`, `.../src/stream-handler.ts`.
- **Gemini Live: user and agent transcriptions are now requested and surfaced.** The Live config never asked for `input_audio_transcription` / `output_audio_transcription`, so Gemini Live calls produced empty transcripts, empty dashboard timelines, and no transcript-based barge-in confirmation; `goAway` (imminent server disconnect) was also swallowed silently. Both SDKs enable both transcription streams, surface them as transcript events, and log `goAway` loudly. `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/gemini_live.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/providers/gemini-live.ts`.
- **Ultravox: corrected realtime event semantics.** Agent transcripts were emitted as cumulative full-text every delta (duplicated text downstream); the `listening` state was mapped to `speech_started` (phantom user-speech events on every turn boundary); and `response_done` never fired. Now: delta-only agent transcript emission with full-text dedup on finals, `speaking→listening` transition emits `response_done`, and `listening` no longer fakes user speech. `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/ultravox_realtime.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/providers/ultravox-realtime.ts`.
- **(Python) 1-hour max-call watchdog (parity with TypeScript).** A call whose carrier never sent `stop` (half-open WS) could run a handler — and bill STT/TTS — forever; TS already force-closed at 60 min. All three Python handlers now arm the same watchdog at start and cancel it in cleanup. `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`.
- **AEC (NLMS): stale far-end reference no longer corrupts the near-end signal.** When the agent stopped speaking, the canceller kept adapting against the last far-end frames indefinitely, distorting caller audio during long agent silences. The canceller now passes audio through untouched once the far-end reference is >250 ms stale, and the adaptation floor was raised (1e-6 → 1e-3) so comfort-noise-level far frames don't drive adaptation. `libraries/python/getpatter/audio/aec.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/audio/aec.ts`.
- **Speech-edge events now fire in PIPELINE mode too (both SDKs).** The seven `SpeechEvents` callbacks (`on_user_speech_started/_ended/_eos`, `on_agent_speech_started/_ended`, …) only fired on the realtime engines; pipeline calls emitted nothing. The pipeline VAD edges, turn commit (EOS with `vad_silence`/`manual_commit` trigger), and agent speaking begin/end (including `interrupted: true` on barge-in) are now wired, and the dispatcher is threaded through all three Python carrier bridges into every handler. `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`, `.../telephony/*.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts`.
- **`events.jsonl` is finally written.** The per-call log directory documented `events.jsonl` (operational events) since 0.6 but nothing ever wrote it. The server logging wrappers now persist `tool_call`/`tool_result` records from `role="tool"` transcript events, `barge_in` (with `turn_index` + `bargein_ms`) from interrupted turns, and `error` from the terminal `CallMetrics.error_code` — which is also persisted as the `error` field of `metadata.json`. `libraries/python/getpatter/server.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/server.ts`.
- **A wave of provider/transport correctness fixes from the full-codebase review** (both SDKs unless noted): Telnyx outbound media pinned to PCMU 8 kHz; raw 32-byte Ed25519 public keys from the Telnyx portal accepted for webhook verification; Telnyx `on_call_end` reads the handler's real conversation history; Cartesia TTS no longer double-decimates to 8 kHz; Telnyx TTS wire format corrected; LLM streams use an idle-reset watchdog instead of a fixed 30 s ceiling (long tool-running turns no longer die mid-stream); HTTP errors from non-OpenAI LLM providers surface instead of draining silently; missing `Union` imports in 8 Python provider modules; GA realtime listener leak; tool-executor timeout defaults, breaker probe gating, and Gemini schema sanitization; eager OpenAI-key validation in TS `agent()` (parity with Python). See the PR for the per-fix details and regression tests.
- **Multi-turn pipeline conversations no longer go silent after the first turn.** The agent answered the first turn but then ignored every subsequent utterance, leaving a ghost metrics turn of `user_text='' agent_text='[interrupted]'`. Two root causes in the pipeline turn-taking state machine:
  - **Tail-grace misclassified the next turn as a barge-in.** After the agent finishes speaking, `_end_speaking_with_grace` keeps `_is_speaking=true` for `PATTER_TTS_TAIL_GRACE_MS` (default 1500 ms) to swallow the fading TTS echo tail. Humans reply in 200-700 ms — inside that window — so the user's next utterance was treated as a barge-in: it recorded an interrupted turn and the leading audio was withheld from STT (only a ≤260 ms echo-contaminated ring), so no final transcript was produced and the agent never answered. A new `_tail_grace_active` / `tailGraceActive` flag now distinguishes "actively streaming TTS" from "post-TTS echo guard"; a VAD `speech_start` (or a transcript) during the tail grace ends the grace and is dispatched as a clean new turn — recovering the leading audio from the ring instead of dropping it — with no spurious `record_turn_interrupted`. Tunable `PATTER_TTS_TAIL_GRACE_MS` (0 / 200 / 1500) is now safe for fast next-turn speech.
  - **(Python) A barge-in's per-turn cancel event leaked into the next turn.** `_llm_cancel_event` was only recreated *inside* `_process_streaming_response` — after `LLMLoop.run` had already been handed the (still-set) event for the next turn — so the turn following any real barge-in bailed immediately. The event is now recreated at the top of `_dispatch_turn`, before dispatch (TypeScript already allocated a fresh `AbortController` per turn). `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts`.
- **Pipeline barge-in now works DURING a turn — including long Hermes/OpenClaw tool-running turns.** The caller could not interrupt the agent mid-response: the STT receive loop awaited the turn's LLM+TTS dispatch inline (`await self._dispatch_turn(...)` / `await this.runPipelineLlm(...)`), so for the whole 30-90 s of a tool-running agent-runtime turn it stopped reading transcripts — a barge-in transcript was only processed *after* the turn ended ("ferma" → answered late). Three coordinated changes, full Python/TS parity:
  - **Decoupled, single-in-flight dispatch.** The turn now runs as one tracked background task (`_dispatch_task` / `dispatchTask`) so the receive loop keeps draining transcripts and runs barge-in detection against the LIVE turn. Exactly one dispatch is in flight: the loop settles the previous one before launching the next, so `conversation_history` / metrics ordering is unchanged. With no barge-in (default, VAD present, normal LLM) behaviour is unchanged — the loop still awaits the final turn to settle before returning.
  - **Prompt pre-first-token abort (Python).** Agent runtimes run tools for tens of seconds before the first token, during which the per-chunk `cancel_event` check never runs. The provider now races `create()` + first-byte against the cancel signal and spawns a watchdog that `close()`s the response the instant a barge-in fires, so the request is torn down immediately instead of blocking the next turn (TS already aborts promptly via `fetch` + `AbortController`). The VAD legacy barge-in branch now also sets `_llm_cancel_event` (it previously only flipped `_is_speaking`), and the OpenAI-compatible client uses an explicit httpx read/connect timeout so a dead gateway fails fast.
  - **`PATTER_FORWARD_STT_WHILE_SPEAKING` (opt-in, default off).** Forwards inbound audio to STT during TTS even with a VAD configured, so the transcript barge-in path can receive a transcript on echo-masked PSTN links where the VAD never fires. The leading-edge ring buffer is still captured. **Echo caveat:** without AEC the agent's own voice may be transcribed as a phantom interruption — pair with `agent.barge_in_strategies`. `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`, `.../services/llm_loop.py`, `.../llm/openai_compatible.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts`.
- **Echo-safe barge-in: the agent no longer interrupts itself, and a fast real follow-up is no longer lost.** Hardening for the echo-prone agent-runtime case (`PATTER_FORWARD_STT_WHILE_SPEAKING` on, no AEC), where the agent's own TTS bled into STT and was transcribed (e.g. a garbled fragment in another language not covered by the English hallucination filter), firing a phantom barge-in and leaving an empty `[interrupted]` turn:
  - **Echo guard** — a language-agnostic check (`_looks_like_echo` / `looksLikeEcho`: substring or ≥60% word overlap against the agent's in-flight spoken text) now drops any candidate barge-in/commit that is the agent's own speech echoing back. Active only while forwarding audio during TTS, so the default VAD path and real post-turn replies are untouched.
  - **Back-to-back dedup fix** — a final within 500 ms of the previous is now dropped only when it is a *near-duplicate* (Deepgram emitting `speech_final` then `is_final` for the same utterance). A genuinely different fast follow-up (e.g. the real interruption right after a suppressed phantom) is kept instead of being silently swallowed into an empty turn.
  - **Interrupted-turn context rewrite** — on a confirmed mid-turn barge-in the spoken prefix is recorded in history with an `[interrupted by caller]` marker (instead of an ungrounded full reply), so a stateful agent runtime (Hermes/OpenClaw, keyed by `X-Hermes-Session-Id`) sees on the next turn that it was cut off and what the caller actually heard. `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts`.
- **Forward-STT-without-AEC no longer self-interrupts on its own echo.** The remaining live Hermes/OpenClaw barge-in failure: with `PATTER_FORWARD_STT_WHILE_SPEAKING` on, no AEC, and no `barge_in_strategies`, a VAD `speech_start` during TTS cancelled the turn immediately — but on a no-AEC link that `speech_start` is very often the agent's *own* TTS echo (or pre-first-token line noise during a long tool-running turn). The result was a cascade of false-positive interruptions: a short normal reply like "bene bene" produced `agent_text='[interrupted]'` with `bargein_ms≈0`, and the next turn's LLM ran for seconds but emitted `tts_characters=0` because it was torn down before its first token. The echo guard existed only on the *transcript* path, so the raw VAD-energy cancel had no protection. The VAD-energy cancel is now **deferred to transcript confirmation** whenever audio is forwarded during TTS without AEC (`forward_stt_while_speaking && aec is None`), exactly as it already was when `barge_in_strategies` are configured: the `speech_start` marks the barge-in *pending* (the agent keeps talking) and the cancel only fires once `_handle_barge_in` / `handleBargeIn` sees a real transcript that survives the echo guard; if none confirms within `barge_in_confirm_ms` (default 1500 ms) the agent resumes its sentence. The default VAD path and forward-STT *with* AEC keep the responsive immediate cancel — no behaviour change for existing configs. For the cleanest short-echo handling, still pair with `echo_cancellation=True` or `barge_in_strategies`. `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts`.
- **Barge-in now works while the carrier is still PLAYING a long buffered reply — the "Hermes detects the interruption but keeps talking" bug.** The pipeline pushes TTS audio to the carrier as fast as the provider synthesizes it (no pacing) while the carrier buffers and plays at realtime. With a token-paced LLM the two stay roughly in sync, but an agent-runtime LLM (`HermesLLM` / `OpenClawLLM`) delivers its whole — often long — reply at once after the thinking pause: TTS outruns realtime and the carrier ends up holding tens of seconds of queued audio. The handler's speaking state ended a fixed `PATTER_TTS_TAIL_GRACE_MS` (1.5 s) after the last *push*, not the last *playback* — so for most of the audible reply `_is_speaking` was already false, every VAD `speech_start` / transcript was treated as a calm next turn instead of a barge-in, `send_clear` was never sent, and the buffered audio kept playing over the caller (with the next turn's reply queued behind it). The handler now tracks an **estimated playback cursor** (`_playback_buffered_until` / `playbackBufferedUntil`, advanced per pushed chunk at the chunk's real byte rate — PCM16@16kHz or carrier-native μ-law@8kHz) and `_end_speaking_with_grace` waits in two phases: phase 1 keeps `_is_speaking=true` with `_tail_grace_active=false` for the whole estimated backlog (barge-in stays armed and takes the full cancel + `send_clear` path, which drops the carrier buffer instantly); phase 2 is the unchanged echo-tail grace. Barge-in cancels reset the cursor (the buffer was just cleared). No new config; token-paced LLMs (no backlog) behave byte-identically to before, and `PATTER_TTS_TAIL_GRACE_MS=0` still forces the legacy synchronous flip. This is the industry-standard semantics (stop + flush client-side regardless of LLM state — cf. Twilio media-stream `clear`). `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts`.
- **Interrupted-turn history now records the reply prefix the caller actually HEARD (LiveKit-style truncation), not everything the LLM generated.** Builds on the playback cursor above. Two gaps closed: (a) on a **mid-turn** barge-in with an agent-runtime LLM, the whole reply had already been synthesized into the carrier buffer, so the `[interrupted by caller]` marker was appended to the FULL text — a stateful runtime (Hermes/OpenClaw) believed the caller heard everything; (b) on a barge-in landing **after the turn completed** (while the carrier still played the buffered tail) no marker was applied at all. The handler now tracks per-turn `(sentence, playback_start)` segments (`_turn_spoken_segments` / `turnSpokenSegments`; filler and `llm_error_message` audio advance the clock but add no segment) and maps `heard = total_pushed − carrier_backlog` to a sentence-granular prefix: the streaming path records `<heard prefix> [interrupted by caller]`, and the post-complete cancel paths rewrite the last assistant history entry the same way before clearing the buffer. No new config; with no tracked segments (e.g. no TTS) the legacy full-text marker is preserved. `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts`.
- **(Python) Twilio/Plivo mark frames now carry the caller-supplied name — first-message pacing no longer burns the mark-await timeout on every call.** `TwilioAudioSender.send_mark` (and the Plivo checkpoint equivalent) discarded the `mark_name` argument and sent a locally generated `audio_N` instead, so the `fm_N` echo the first-message pacer waited for never matched and every mark resolved via the 0.5 s fallback timeout (~1.5 s of guaranteed extra latency in the barge-in window of every Twilio call). The wire name is now the caller's, matching the TypeScript behaviour. `libraries/python/getpatter/telephony/twilio.py`, `.../telephony/plivo.py`.
- **(TypeScript) Inbound audio frames are now awaited — a transient audio-path error can no longer kill the whole server.** All three carrier WS message handlers called `handler.handleAudio(...)` without `await`, so a rejection inside the audio path (VAD, resampler, STT send) escaped the surrounding `try/catch` and became an unhandled rejection, which terminates the Node process (Node 15+) together with every active call. `libraries/typescript/src/server.ts`.
- **(TypeScript) Telnyx calls no longer leak `activeCallIds` entries.** The Telnyx WS close handler was the only one of the three carriers that never deleted its `ws → call_control_id` map entry, so the map grew for the server's lifetime and graceful shutdown issued hangup REST calls for long-dead calls. `libraries/typescript/src/server.ts`.
- **Pipeline context rebuild no longer replays tool history entries as fabricated user turns.** `role="tool"` transcript entries (display/dashboard artefacts) were mapped to `role: "user"` when rebuilding the OpenAI messages array, injecting raw tool JSON into the conversation as if the caller had said it. They are now skipped — the tool outcome is already reflected in the assistant's following reply. `libraries/python/getpatter/services/llm_loop.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/llm-loop.ts`.
- **(Python) Removed deprecated `asyncio.get_event_loop()` calls from running-loop contexts.** `_send_mark_awaitable` now uses `get_running_loop()`, and the ElevenLabs WS TTS barge-in cancel schedules the close on the loop captured at stream start (with a done-callback that surfaces close errors) instead of relying on `get_event_loop()` + `ensure_future`, which raises on Python 3.12+ when no loop is current on the calling thread. `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`, `.../providers/elevenlabs_ws_tts.py`.
- **(Python) The pre-barge-in inbound audio ring is now a `deque(maxlen=13)`.** The previous `list` + `pop(0)` eviction was O(n) and ran per media frame (~50/s) while the agent spoke; the flush path also snapshots before awaiting so a concurrent frame can't mutate the buffer mid-replay. `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`.
- **`agent.audio_filter` / `audioFilter` is now actually applied — it was a silent no-op.** The noise-suppression filter (Krisp, DeepFilterNet) was accepted by the public API, documented as "integrated before VAD and STT", fully implemented and unit-tested — but never invoked by any pipeline: inbound audio reached VAD/STT unfiltered regardless of the setting. The inbound processing path (mulaw decode → stateful 8k→16k resample → AEC near-end → VAD feed) is now extracted into an `InputProcessingChain` (slice 1 of the pipeline-stages decomposition — `docs/architecture/pipeline-stages.md`) which applies `audio_filter` **after AEC and before VAD**, per the `AudioFilter` contract, so VAD and STT both benefit from the cleaned signal. The wrapper is fail-open: a raising (or non-bytes-returning) filter degrades to passthrough with a single WARN (then DEBUG) and the call audio path stays alive. With no AEC/filter/VAD configured the byte path is identical to before. Relatedly, **(Python) `KrispVivaFilter` now re-frames input internally** to its configured `frame_duration_ms` (buffering any remainder) instead of raising a frame-size mismatch — the pipeline's 20 ms telephony frames previously violated the default 10 ms Krisp frame contract on every frame. New `libraries/python/getpatter/services/input_chain.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/services/input-chain.ts`; `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`, `.../providers/krisp_filter.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts`.

### Security

- **Telnyx webhook anti-replay window aligned across SDKs: future-dated timestamps are rejected beyond a 30 s clock-skew allowance.** Python previously accepted timestamps up to 5 minutes in the FUTURE (`abs(age)` check), doubling the replay window for pre-issued signatures; TypeScript previously rejected ANY future timestamp, dropping legitimate webhooks on hosts whose clock lags Telnyx by even a second. Both now accept `[-30 s, +300 s]` of age. `libraries/python/getpatter/server.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/server.ts`.
- **(TypeScript) `sanitizeVariables` now strips control characters and caps values at 500 chars (parity with Python).** Caller-supplied template variables (carrier custom params) are interpolated into the system prompt; a newline-bearing value could append adversarial prompt lines. `libraries/typescript/src/server.ts`.
- **(TypeScript) LLM API error bodies are truncated to 200 chars in logs.** Provider 401 bodies have been observed to embed the rejected API-key prefix; the thrown error message was already capped but the ERROR-level log line was not. `libraries/typescript/src/llm-loop.ts`.
- **Dependency advisories resolved via lockfile bump (`npm audit fix`): `hono` → 4.12.21+ (4 moderate advisories: IPv6 deny-rule bypass, Set-Cookie injection, JWT scheme laxness, percent-encoded mount routing) and `vitest` → 3.2.6+ (dev-only critical, Vitest UI arbitrary file read).** `libraries/typescript/package-lock.json`.

## 0.6.5 (2026-06-05)

### Added

- **`llm_error_message` / `llmErrorMessage` — opt-in spoken fallback when the
  pipeline-mode LLM stream raises before any text is spoken.** Agent-runtime
  providers (HermesLLM, OpenClawLLM, OpenAICompatibleLLM) may take 30-90 s to
  complete a turn (tools, memory, skills); on gateway-down or timeout the caller
  previously heard silence then a silent turn-end. Set
  `llm_error_message="Sorry, I'm having trouble right now."` (Python) /
  `llmErrorMessage: "Sorry, I'm having trouble right now."` (TypeScript) on the
  agent to speak that line through the normal TTS path (subject to barge-in).
  Four-part trigger condition: (1) a real LLM error (not a clean barge-in
  abort), (2) zero assistant *audio* emitted this turn — gated on whether a PCM
  chunk actually reached the carrier (`first_tts_chunk` / `ttsFirstByteSent`),
  not on whether tokens were received, so a provider that streams partial tokens
  ("Let me check…") and then times out before a sentence boundary (the chunker
  buffered them, TTS never ran, the caller heard silence) still triggers the
  fallback, while a turn that already spoke a full sentence does not double-speak,
  (3) agent still owns the floor, (4) the field is set to a non-empty string.
  `undefined` / `None` (default) preserves today's silence-on-error behaviour —
  fully backward compatible. Pipeline mode only; Realtime and ConvAI surface
  provider errors on their own audio path.
  `libraries/python/getpatter/models.py` (`Agent.llm_error_message`),
  `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py` (`Patter.agent(llm_error_message=...)`),

  `libraries/typescript/src/types.ts` (`AgentOptions.llmErrorMessage`),
  `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts` (`runPipelineLlm` catch branch).

## 0.6.4 (2026-06-05)

### Security

- **The built-in metrics dashboard is now auto-protected with a generated token
  when it would be reachable beyond `127.0.0.1`.** The dashboard UI and the
  `/api/*` call-data routes serve call transcripts and metadata (PII).
  Previously, when the dashboard was enabled with no `dashboard_token` /
  `dashboardToken` on an off-host bind (a tunnel is active, an explicit public
  `webhook_url` / `webhookUrl` is configured, or `PATTER_BIND_HOST` is set to a
  non-loopback address), the SDK published those routes unauthenticated and only
  emitted a soft warning — a foot-gun easy to miss in a tunnelled demo or a
  containerised deploy. Now, in exactly that configuration, the SDK
  auto-generates a one-time token, mounts the dashboard behind it, and prints
  the ready-to-use URL (`http://127.0.0.1:<port>/?token=<token>`) in the startup
  banner. The dashboard remains available with zero config — it is no longer
  reachable unauthenticated by accident. This is **not a breaking change**: the
  dashboard is still always served and inbound/outbound calls are unaffected
  (the carrier webhook, media-stream, and `/health` routes always mount). The
  token is per-process — set `dashboard_token` / `dashboardToken` for a stable
  one across restarts. Loopback-only local dev is unchanged (still served open,
  zero-friction); an explicit `dashboard_token` serves behind that token as
  before.
  - `libraries/python/getpatter/server.py`,
    `libraries/typescript/src/server.ts`.

### Added

- **Patter as a voice shell in front of an agent runtime — three new
  pipeline-mode LLM providers (`OpenAICompatibleLLM`, `HermesLLM`,
  `OpenClawLLM`).** Drive a phone call where the LLM is an external,
  OpenAI-compatible agent runtime reached at `POST {base_url}/chat/completions`:
  Patter owns the carrier leg, STT, turn-taking / VAD / barge-in, and TTS, and
  each conversation turn is answered by the runtime (which can run its own
  tools, memory, and skills before replying). Used like any other pipeline LLM
  — `phone.agent(llm=HermesLLM())` (Python) / `phone.agent({ llm: new
  HermesLLM() })` (TypeScript).
  - **`OpenAICompatibleLLM`** (Python `getpatter/llm/openai_compatible.py`,
    TypeScript `src/llm/openai-compatible.ts`) — the generic provider for *any*
    OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint: Hermes, OpenClaw, Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio,
    or a custom gateway. `base_url` and `model` are required; `timeout` defaults
    to **60 s** (configurable) so a runtime that runs tools mid-turn isn't cut
    off — the base OpenAI provider's shorter ceiling is unchanged for raw
    inference. Keyless local gateways (Ollama / vLLM / LM Studio) are supported:
    pass no key and the request goes out without an `Authorization` header.
    `extra_headers` / `extraHeaders` merge after the `getpatter/<version>`
    User-Agent so it can't be silently clobbered.
  - **`HermesLLM`** (Python `getpatter/llm/hermes.py`, TypeScript
    `src/llm/hermes.ts`) — thin preset over `OpenAICompatibleLLM` for the Hermes
    agent runtime: `base_url` defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8642/v1`, `model` to
    `hermes-agent` (env `API_SERVER_MODEL_NAME` fallback), api key from env
    `API_SERVER_KEY`, `timeout` **120 s**.
  - **`OpenClawLLM`** (Python `getpatter/llm/openclaw.py`, TypeScript
    `src/llm/openclaw.ts`) — thin preset over `OpenAICompatibleLLM` for the
    OpenClaw agent runtime: takes an `agent` id (e.g. `receptionist`), validated
    and mapped to `model="openclaw/<agent>"` using the **same** charset rule and
    namespaced pass-through as the shipped `consult` OpenClaw preset; `base_url`
    defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:18789/v1`, api key from env `OPENCLAW_API_KEY`,
    `timeout` **120 s**.
- **Per-call session continuity for the agent-runtime providers (opt-in), now
  with three decoupled signals.** Each runtime keys session continuity
  differently, so `OpenAICompatibleLLM` exposes three independent, optional
  signals — emit any subset:
  - **`session_user_prefix` / `sessionUserPrefix`** → OpenAI `user` field as a
    stable `{prefix}{call_id}` (value `patter-call-<call_id>` for the presets).
    OpenClaw's gateway derives its session from `user`; Hermes uses it only for
    upstream-log correlation.
  - **`session_id_header` + `session_id_prefix` / `sessionIdHeader` +
    `sessionIdPrefix`** → a per-call request header carrying
    `{session_id_prefix}{call_id}`, for runtimes that key session/transcript
    continuity off a header rather than `user`.
  - **`session_key_header` + `session_key` / `sessionKeyHeader` +
    `sessionKey`** → a *static* request header for long-term memory scoping
    (value is the configured key, not the call id). Omitted unless the value is
    set.

  Each signal is gated independently and merged into the per-request headers;
  when none are configured the request is byte-identical to the base provider
  (no `user`, no extra headers). Preset wiring:
  - **`HermesLLM`** — Hermes is stateless and keys continuity off **headers**:
    `session_id_header="X-Hermes-Session-Id"`, `session_id_prefix="patter-call-"`
    (so each call sends `X-Hermes-Session-Id: patter-call-<call_id>` by default).
    A new optional `session_key` (Python) / `sessionKey` (TypeScript) constructor
    arg, default `None` / `undefined`, opts into long-term memory scoping by
    emitting `X-Hermes-Session-Key: <value>`. `session_user_prefix` is kept at
    `patter-call-` for upstream-log correlation but does **not** drive the Hermes
    session.
  - **`OpenClawLLM`** — wire-identical to before: `session_user_prefix=
    "patter-call-"` (OpenClaw's gateway keys off `user`) plus
    `session_id_header="x-openclaw-session-key"` with `session_id_prefix=""` so
    the header still carries the raw `call_id`. No memory-scope header.

  The presets enable continuity by default; the generic provider leaves it
  **off** unless opted in. To make `call_id` reach the provider, `LLMLoop.run`
  threads it through to `provider.stream()` — Python via an optional `call_id`
  keyword on the `LLMProvider.stream` protocol (the loop now introspects each
  provider's `stream` signature and only passes `call_id` to providers that
  accept it or take `**kwargs`, so a minimal custom provider that declares
  neither is **not** broken), TypeScript via an optional `callId` field on
  `LLMStreamOptions` (an extra options-object property a provider ignores is a
  no-op). Both are additive and optional, so every existing provider is
  unaffected. `libraries/python/getpatter/llm/openai_compatible.py`,
  `libraries/python/getpatter/llm/hermes.py`,
  `libraries/python/getpatter/llm/openclaw.py`,
  `libraries/python/getpatter/services/llm_loop.py`,

  `libraries/typescript/src/llm/hermes.ts`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/llm/openclaw.ts`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/llm-loop.ts`.
- **`allow_insecure_dashboard` / `allowInsecureDashboard` escape hatch (opt-in,
  default off).** New optional config on `Patter(...)` (Python) and `serve(...)`
  `ServeOptions` (TypeScript), defaulting to `False` / `false`. When the
  dashboard would be reachable beyond loopback without a configured token (see
  Security above), the SDK auto-generates a token to protect it; setting this
  flag to `True` / `true` instead serves the dashboard fully OPEN (no token,
  unauthenticated) on that exposed bind and logs a `warning`. This is for
  operators who deliberately run the dashboard open behind their own network
  controls (a tailnet, Cloudflare Access, an upstream auth proxy). It leaks call
  transcripts and metadata (PII) to anyone who can reach the URL, so it is NOT
  recommended on a public network — prefer the auto-generated token, or a stable
  `dashboard_token` / `dashboardToken`. Backward compatible: existing callers
  that pass no token and are loopback-only are unaffected; the flag only matters
  on an exposed bind. `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py` /
  `libraries/python/getpatter/server.py`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/types.ts` /
  `libraries/typescript/src/client.ts` /
  `libraries/typescript/src/server.ts`.

- **OpenAI Realtime input noise reduction — stop speakerphone / room noise from
  cutting the agent off.** New `noise_reduction` on the Realtime engine markers
  (`engines.openai.Realtime(noise_reduction="far_field")` /
  `engines.openai_realtime_2.Realtime2(...)` Python; `new Realtime({ noiseReduction:
  "far_field" })` TS) and a matching `Patter.agent(openai_realtime_noise_reduction=
  "far_field")` / `phone.agent({ openaiRealtimeNoiseReduction: "far_field" })`
  field. On a speakerphone, mouse clicks, phone shifts, and background chatter
  were being detected as the caller speaking and barging in over the agent;
  enabling OpenAI's native `far_field` reduction (recommended for conference /
  speakerphone audio; `near_field` for a close handset) filters that out before
  VAD sees it. `None` / `undefined` (default) omits the field entirely — today's
  behaviour, no reduction. The GA/v2 adapter nests it under
  `session.audio.input.input_audio_noise_reduction`; the v1-beta adapter emits it
  top-level — each at the correct path for that endpoint. Invalid values are
  rejected with a clear error. `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/openai_realtime.py`
  / `openai_realtime_2.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/providers/openai-realtime.ts`
  / `openai-realtime-2.ts`.

- **`RealtimeTurnDetection` — tune the Realtime VAD to reject false barge-in.**
  New immutable config (`from getpatter import RealtimeTurnDetection` Python;
  `RealtimeTurnDetection` interface TS) accepted by the Realtime engine markers
  (`Realtime(turn_detection=...)` / `new Realtime({ turnDetection })`) and
  `Patter.agent(realtime_turn_detection=...)` / `phone.agent({ realtimeTurnDetection })`.
  Raise `threshold` (server_vad — higher rejects more background noise) or switch
  to `type="semantic_vad"` with `eagerness="low"` so the model waits for the
  caller to actually finish before treating audio as speech — the missing knob
  for noisy speakerphone links. Each unset field falls back to the adapter's
  current default (server_vad, threshold 0.5, prefix_padding_ms 300,
  silence_duration_ms 300), so omitting it preserves today's behaviour exactly.
  `semantic_vad` emits `{type, eagerness}` only. `create_response` /
  `interrupt_response` are not exposed here — they are managed by Patter via the
  `gate_response_on_transcript` / `gateResponseOnTranscript` flag (server-managed
  by default; see Changed). `libraries/python/getpatter/models.py`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/types.ts`.

- **`gate_response_on_transcript` / `gateResponseOnTranscript` opt-out (default
  off) — restore the legacy client-managed Realtime turn-taking.** New optional
  flag on the Realtime engine markers (`Realtime(gate_response_on_transcript=True)`
  / `new Realtime({ gateResponseOnTranscript: true })`, plus the `Realtime2` /
  GA marker) and on `Patter.agent(realtime_gate_response_on_transcript=...)` /
  `phone.agent({ realtimeGateResponseOnTranscript })`. Default `False` /
  `undefined` keeps the new server-managed behaviour (see Changed). Set it to
  `True` to emit `create_response: false` + `interrupt_response: false`, which
  re-gates the model response on the input transcript arriving and restores the
  client-driven barge-in (anti-flicker `MIN_AGENT_SPEAKING` gate + client
  `response.cancel` + barge-in metric anchoring) — the escape hatch for no-AEC
  PSTN self-interruption, where the server VAD would otherwise barge-in on the
  echo of the agent's own audio. `libraries/python/getpatter/models.py` /
  `getpatter/engines/openai.py` / `openai_realtime_2.py` /
  `getpatter/providers/openai_realtime.py`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/types.ts` / `engines/openai.ts` / `engines/openai-2.ts`
  / `providers/openai-realtime.ts`.

- **Per-tool execution timeout — long (30-60s) browser-automation / external-API
  tools no longer drop the call at 10s.** New `timeout_s` on the Python `tool()`
  factory and `Tool` dataclass (`tool(name=..., handler=..., timeout_s=60.0)`) and
  `timeoutMs` on the TS `ToolDefinition` (`{ name, handler, timeoutMs: 60_000 }`).
  Previously the tool executor aborted every tool at a hardcoded 10s, killing
  slow tools mid-run; the per-tool value now governs both the handler await and
  the webhook request (clamped to a 300s / 300_000ms ceiling). A timeout is
  terminal — it is NOT retried (retrying would multiply the wait and stall the
  turn) and returns a structured `{error, fallback: true}` so the model can
  recover. Default `None` / `undefined` keeps the existing 10s behaviour. The
  per-tool timeout governs tool execution and is independent of any LLM
  provider's own stream ceiling. The carrier media stream stays open across the
  whole tool call — Twilio keeps the WS up for the call lifetime — so a long tool
  does not drop the leg; pair `timeout_s` with `reassurance` so the line doesn't
  sound dead. `libraries/python/getpatter/tools/tool_executor.py` /
  `services/llm_loop.py` / `_public_api.py`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/llm-loop.ts` / `public-api.ts`.

- **`reassurance` on the Python `tool()` factory — a verbal "one moment" while a
  slow tool runs.** The `Tool` dataclass and `ToolDefinition` already carried
  `reassurance`; it is now exposed on the Python `tool()` keyword factory and
  decorator (`tool(name=..., handler=..., reassurance="One moment while I check
  that for you.")`, or the dict form `{"message": str, "after_ms": int}`) for
  parity with TS object-literal usage. Honoured in Realtime mode (the agent
  speaks the filler if the tool hasn't returned within `after_ms`); pipeline-mode
  injection remains out of scope. `libraries/python/getpatter/_public_api.py`,
  `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py`.

- **`tool_call_preambles` on `Patter.agent(...)` (Realtime modes) — the agent
  speaks a short "let me check" line in its own voice before a slow tool call.**
  Opt-in `bool | str` (default `False`) on `Patter.agent(tool_call_preambles=...)`
  / `phone.agent({ toolCallPreambles })`. When `True`, Patter prepends a native
  "# Preambles" guidance block to the OpenAI Realtime session `instructions` so
  the reasoning model emits one short, action-describing sentence (e.g. "I'll
  check that order now.") immediately before a tool call that may take a moment —
  OpenAI's recommended, first-class UX for 30-60 s tools (most effective on
  `gpt-realtime-2`, where preambles are default-on), with no API field and no
  client-side timer. The block steers the model to vary wording, keep it to one
  sentence, skip it when it can answer immediately, and never imply the result
  before the tool returns. A `str` overrides the block verbatim. When a tool
  also carries a `reassurance` string, that phrase is surfaced to the model as a
  sample preamble in the tool's description. Default `False` leaves the prompt
  byte-identical to prior releases; pipeline mode is unaffected (it has its own
  phone preamble). `libraries/python/getpatter/models.py`,
  `.../client.py`, `.../stream_handler.py` (`apply_tool_call_preambles`,
  `DEFAULT_TOOL_CALL_PREAMBLE_BLOCK`),
  `libraries/typescript/src/types.ts`, `.../stream-handler.ts`
  (`applyToolCallPreambles`).

- **Built-in `consult` escalation tool — give an in-call agent an on-demand
  bridge back to your own back-office agent.** New `ConsultConfig`
  (`getpatter` Python / TS) on `Patter.agent(consult=...)` /
  `phone.agent({ consult })`. When set, Patter auto-injects a `consult_agent`
  tool (Realtime + Pipeline modes) that the in-call agent invokes mid-call to
  reach a customer-hosted HTTP endpoint for deeper reasoning or fresh
  information, then speaks the reply — the orchestrator stays off the per-turn
  path (consulted only on demand), so ordinary turns keep their low latency.
  The tool POSTs `{request, call_id, caller, callee}` and accepts a JSON
  `reply` / `response` / `text` string (or any JSON / plain text). Configurable
  `headers` (e.g. an `Authorization` bearer; never logged) and `timeout_s` /
  `timeoutMs` (default 30 s — higher than the generic webhook-tool 10 s because
  a consult may run deeper reasoning). The URL is SSRF-validated at call start;
  endpoint failures degrade to a spoken fallback rather than crashing the turn.
  ElevenLabs ConvAI is unsupported (its tools live on the ElevenLabs-hosted
  agent) and emits a warning. As a side effect, MCP and consult tools resolved
  per-call are now also advertised to the Realtime model (previously only the
  static `agent.tools` were). `libraries/python/getpatter/tools/consult.py`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/consult.ts`.

- **`ConsultConfig.allow_loopback` / `allowLoopback` — opt-in to point
  `consult` at a trusted local agent.** New optional flag (default `False` /
  `undefined`) on `ConsultConfig`. The consult URL is SSRF-validated at build
  time, which by default rejects loopback / private / link-local hosts. Set
  `allow_loopback=True` (Python) / `allowLoopback: true` (TS) to relax those
  host checks for the consult URL only — e.g. a back-office orchestrator on
  `127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, or an RFC1918 private host. Non-HTTP(S) schemes are
  still rejected even with the flag, and every other webhook path stays strict;
  the relaxation is scoped to the developer-configured consult endpoint, which
  is SDK-user config, not caller input. Cloud-metadata hostnames also become
  reachable when opted in — only enable for URLs you control.
  `libraries/python/getpatter/models.py`,
  `libraries/python/getpatter/tools/tool_executor.py`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/types.ts`, `libraries/typescript/src/server.ts`.

- **Native OpenClaw / OpenAI-compatible `consult` target — connect the voice
  layer to an OpenClaw agent with no hand-written adapter.**
  `ConsultConfig.openclaw(agent=...)` (Python) / `openclawConsult(agent)` (TS)
  point `consult` straight at an OpenClaw agent over its OpenAI-compatible
  `POST /v1/chat/completions` gateway: the handler sends
  `{model: "openclaw/<agent>", messages, user: call_id, stream: false}` and
  speaks `choices[0].message.content`. Built on a generic
  `OpenAICompatibleConsult` codec (`base_url` + `model` + optional `api_key` /
  `api_key_env` / `session_header`), so the same primitive drives any
  OpenAI-compatible gateway (vLLM, Ollama, Groq). The OpenClaw preset targets
  the loopback gateway (`http://127.0.0.1:18789/v1`) by default, auto-enables
  `allow_loopback` for that co-located gateway, reads the operator-grade bearer
  from `OPENCLAW_API_KEY` (never logged), sends the call id as both
  `x-openclaw-session-key` and the OpenAI `user` field (one OpenClaw session per
  call), and attaches a default "let me check" reassurance filler plus a
  consult-biased ("always consult for account facts; never answer them from
  memory") tool description. `timeout_s` / `timeoutMs` keep the phone-safe 30 s
  default. The generic `ConsultConfig(url=...)` webhook path is unchanged and
  remains the escape hatch for custom mappings; exactly one of `url` /
  `openai_compatible` must be set. A 404 from the gateway logs an actionable
  hint to enable `gateway.http.endpoints.chatCompletions`.
  `libraries/python/getpatter/models.py`,
  `libraries/python/getpatter/tools/consult.py`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/types.ts`, `libraries/typescript/src/consult.ts`.

- **OpenClaw post-call notify (`on_call_end` → OpenClaw).** New
  `openclaw_post_call_notifier(agent)` (Python) /
  `openclawPostCallNotifier(agent)` (TS) returns an `on_call_end` callback that
  POSTs the finished call's record (caller, dialed line, duration, transcript) to
  the same scoped OpenClaw agent over its OpenAI-compatible gateway, keyed to the
  call id (`user` + `x-openclaw-session-key`) so it lands in the SAME OpenClaw
  session as the in-call `consult` turns — the brain keeps the record and can
  follow up. Fire-and-forget: errors are logged by type only and never raised
  into call teardown. Wire it on `serve(on_call_end=...)`.
  `libraries/python/getpatter/tools/consult.py`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/consult.ts`.

- **Dashboard: Plivo carrier support in the UI.** The call dashboard now
  renders a Plivo `CarrierBadge` and maps Plivo calls across the cost,
  live-call, and metrics panels, alongside Twilio and Telnyx
  (`dashboard-app/`). Also added `"plivo"` to the PyPI / npm package keywords
  so the SDK surfaces in Plivo-related searches. (#123)
- **`PatterConfigError` (both SDKs).** Added to the TypeScript error taxonomy
  (`errors.ts`) to match Python's `PatterConfigError`, and exported from the
  Python package root — raised for invalid SDK configuration.
- **New Python package exports**: `resample_pcm`, `define_tool`, `DTMF_EVENTS`,
  barge-in strategy helpers, and pricing constants (`PricingUnit`,
  `PRICING_VERSION`, `PRICING_LAST_UPDATED`) are now importable from `getpatter`
  for parity with the TypeScript surface.

### Changed

- **End-to-end OpenAI Realtime turn-taking is now fully server-managed (lower
  latency, correct barge-in).** For the `OpenAIRealtime` (v1) and
  `OpenAIRealtime2` (GA) engines the OpenAI server now owns VAD, end-of-turn
  detection, response creation, AND the barge-in cancel — Patter no longer
  drives any of them client-side (`turn_detection.create_response` and
  `interrupt_response` are both on by default). Two user-visible effects:
  - **The agent replies as soon as the caller stops speaking**, driven by the
    server's audio-buffer commit, instead of waiting ~500 ms for the Whisper
    input transcript. The transcript is now pure observability (dashboard /
    history / `on_transcript`); it never gates or cancels the response — so the
    input-transcription model choice no longer affects reply latency, and a
    Whisper hallucination can no longer suppress a real reply.
  - **Barge-in is handled by the server.** When the caller talks over the
    agent, the server cancels its own response. On Patter's WebSocket transport
    the client still clears the carrier playout buffer and sends
    `conversation.item.truncate` for the played offset (OpenAI only
    auto-truncates on WebRTC/SIP), but the client-side anti-flicker
    `MIN_AGENT_SPEAKING` gate, the manual `response.cancel`, and the barge-in
    metric re-anchoring were removed from the engine path. The re-anchoring was
    inflating `total_ms` (it re-anchored the turn to user-speech-start) and
    caused a multi-second freeze after a barge-in; reported reply latency now
    reflects the true server round-trip again.
  Tune false barge-ins on noisy / no-AEC PSTN links with `RealtimeTurnDetection`
  (raise `threshold`, or `semantic_vad` `eagerness="low"`) rather than a client
  gate. **Not an API break** — no signature changed and the prior client-managed
  path remains available via the opt-out flag (see Added). ElevenLabs ConvAI
  (already server-managed — `sendClear` only) and Pipeline mode (client-owned
  Silero VAD + barge-in) are unchanged.
  `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/openai_realtime.py` / `openai_realtime_2.py`
  / `stream_handler.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/providers/openai-realtime.ts`
  / `openai-realtime-2.ts` / `stream-handler.ts`.
- **Public config collections are now immutable.** `Agent.tools` / `guardrails`
  / `text_transforms` / `mcp_servers` and `Guardrail.blocked_terms` are tuples
  (Python, `frozen=True`) / `readonly` arrays (TypeScript). Code comparing these
  against a literal `list`/array must compare against a tuple / readonly array.
- **Default `Agent.model` is now `gpt-realtime-mini`** (was
  `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview`), aligning the Python dataclass default with the
  TypeScript adapter default. Both are aliases for the same OpenAI Realtime model
  family and share the same pricing row, so cost is unaffected — this removes a
  Python↔TypeScript default mismatch and an internal Python inconsistency (the
  `agent()` helper already defaulted to `gpt-realtime-mini`).

### Fixed

- **Twilio + OpenAI Realtime (`OpenAIRealtime()` engine) garbled/static audio
  on all models (TypeScript).** The TypeScript SDK still routed the
  `openai_realtime` engine through the legacy v1-beta adapter, which sent the
  deprecated flat `output_audio_format: g711_ulaw` session shape to the GA
  Realtime endpoint. OpenAI's GA models (the v1 engine defaults to
  `gpt-realtime-mini`) ignore the flat field and return PCM16 @ 24 kHz, which
  Patter then forwarded to Twilio framed as 8 kHz mulaw — producing persistent
  static and breaking inbound STT (the model transcribed the noise as random
  text). Both the `openai_realtime` and `openai_realtime_2` engines now route
  through the GA adapter (`OpenAIRealtime2Adapter`, selected in
  `libraries/typescript/src/server.ts`), which sends the nested
  `audio.{input,output}.format = { type: "audio/pcm", rate: 24000 }` shape and
  transcodes PCM24→mulaw8 internally — matching the Python SDK, which already
  unified this routing in `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`. The
  default model is unchanged (`gpt-realtime-mini` for `OpenAIRealtime`,
  `gpt-realtime-2` for `OpenAIRealtime2`). Also added a log-only warning (both
  SDKs) when the server-echoed effective output format differs from the
  requested `audio/pcm` @ 24 kHz, so any future GA schema drift surfaces in
  logs instead of as silent static. `libraries/typescript/src/server.ts`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/providers/openai-realtime-2.ts`,
  `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/openai_realtime_2.py`.

- **Realtime tool context now includes `callee` (TypeScript).** In Realtime
  mode the TypeScript tool-dispatch context passed `{ call_id, caller }` only,
  omitting `callee` (the dialed line) — Python Realtime and TypeScript Pipeline
  already included it. Tools that use the dialed line (e.g. the OpenClaw consult
  system message's "Line dialed: …", or post-call notify) now receive it in every
  mode and both SDKs. `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts`.

- **Reassurance filler no longer injects a phantom caller turn.** The slow-tool
  reassurance filler (`tool(reassurance=...)`) previously fired
  `conversation.item.create` with `role:"user"`, so the transcript falsely
  showed the caller saying "One moment." and the fake user turn could confuse
  the model. It now speaks via a dedicated assistant-attributed
  `send_reassurance()` / `sendReassurance()` path — a bare `response.create`
  with explicit instructions, no fake user item — matching how
  `send_first_message` already makes the agent speak a verbatim line without a
  `role:user` turn. The shared `send_text()` (used by guardrail replacement,
  tool progress, and DTMF) is untouched. Early-cancel is preserved: nothing is
  spoken if the tool returns before `after_ms`. On the GA adapter the filler
  uses the GA-valid `output_modalities` + re-injected voice (the GA endpoint
  rejects the v1 `modalities` key). `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/openai_realtime.py`
  / `openai_realtime_2.py`, `.../stream_handler.py` (`_schedule_reassurance`),
  `libraries/typescript/src/providers/openai-realtime.ts` / `openai-realtime-2.ts`,
  `.../stream-handler.ts`.
- **DeepFilterNet noise suppression was a silent no-op.** The resampler could
  never reach the 48 kHz the model requires, the error was swallowed, and raw
  audio passed through unsuppressed. Now resampled correctly
  (`providers/deepfilternet_filter.py`, `providers/deepfilternet-filter.ts`).
- **Parallel tool-calls returned a 400 from Anthropic and Gemini.** Multiple
  tool results in one turn produced consecutive same-role messages both
  providers reject; they are now merged into a single turn in both SDKs
  (`providers/anthropic_llm.py` / `anthropic-llm.ts`, `providers/google_llm.py`
  / `google-llm.ts`).
- **Anthropic prompt-cache savings were not billed in TypeScript.** The TS
  Anthropic provider now emits cache read/write token counts on its usage chunk
  (parity with Python), so cached-prompt cost reductions are reflected in the
  metrics (`providers/anthropic-llm.ts`).
- **MCP client URLs were not SSRF-guarded.** Both SDKs now validate the MCP
  server URL (blocking link-local, loopback, and private ranges) before opening
  the transport (`tools/mcp_client.py`, `tools/mcp-client.ts`).
- **AMD callbacks were clobbered across concurrent outbound calls.** The single
  answering-machine-detection slot is now a per-call map in both SDKs, keyed by
  call SID (`server.py` / `server.ts`, `client.ts`).
- **`FallbackLLMProvider` crashed in pipeline mode (Python).** `stream()` now
  accepts and forwards `cancel_event`, matching how the pipeline invokes every
  provider (`services/fallback_provider.py`).
- **Blocking model/inference calls ran on the event loop.** Krisp and Whisper
  now offload to `asyncio.to_thread` so audio is not dropped
  (`providers/krisp_filter.py`, `providers/whisper_stt.py`).
- **WebSocket reads could hang indefinitely.** Added read timeouts and surfaced
  background-task exceptions across providers and the remote-message path
  (`services/remote_message.py` / `remote-message.ts`).
- **ElevenLabs API key was a publicly readable field.** It is now private in
  both SDKs (`providers/elevenlabs_ws_tts.py`, `providers/elevenlabs-ws-tts.ts`).
- **Async done-callbacks raised `CancelledError` on normal shutdown.** They now
  guard `cancelled()` before reading `.exception()` (`observability/event_bus.py`,
  `providers/cartesia_stt.py`, `dashboard/store.py`).
- **Pipeline could accumulate orphaned conversation-history turns.** The
  speculative user turn is popped on the no-handler / vetoed path
  (`stream_handler.py`).
- **Py↔TS parity drift fixed**: `DTMF_EVENTS` ordering, the OpenAI TTS default
  model, and the end-of-utterance metric emit guard now match across SDKs.
- **Telnyx STT logs now use the `getpatter.*` namespace.**
  `providers/telnyx_stt.py` logged under the stale `patter.providers.telnyx_stt`
  namespace; aligned to `getpatter.providers.telnyx_stt` like every other module
  so `getpatter.*` log-level filters capture it.
- **Pipeline-mode turns after the first now record per-turn metrics and
  broadcast the live dashboard transcript.** `anchorUserSpeechStart()` re-opened
  a turn (set `_turnStart`) without clearing the `_turnAlreadyClosed` guard, so
  every user→agent turn after the `firstMessage` made `recordTurnComplete()` a
  no-op — silently dropping per-turn latency/cost AND the live SSE
  `turn_complete` event that feeds the dashboard transcript (the transcript only
  appeared after the call ended). Cleared the flag in `anchorUserSpeechStart()`,
  mirroring what `startTurn()` already does, in both SDKs
  (`libraries/typescript/src/metrics.ts`,
  `libraries/python/getpatter/services/metrics.py`). The post-commit barge-in
  guard is untouched — the method no-ops once the turn is committed.

### Security

- **Bumped vulnerable transitive/runtime dependencies in the TypeScript SDK**
  (`libraries/typescript/package-lock.json`). `ws` 8.20.0 → 8.21.0 closes an
  uninitialised-memory disclosure (GHSA-58qx-3vcg-4xpx); `qs` 6.15.1 → 6.15.2
  (pulled in by `express` / `body-parser`) closes a `qs.stringify` DoS
  (GHSA-q8mj-m7cp-5q26); `brace-expansion` → 5.0.6 / 2.1.0 closes a regex DoS
  (GHSA-jxxr-4gwj-5jf2). All within the existing semver ranges — no `package.json`
  change, no public API change. `npm audit` now reports 0 vulnerabilities for the
  shipped SDK.

## 0.6.3 (2026-05-29)

### Added

- **Plivo as a third telephony carrier (both SDKs), full Twilio/Telnyx
  parity.** `Patter(carrier=Plivo(), ...)` / `new Patter({ carrier: new
  Plivo(), ... })` — outbound dials via Plivo's REST API (`answer_url` /
  `hangup_url` / async `machine_detection_url`), inbound voice/status/AMD/
  transfer webhooks with **V3 HMAC-SHA256 signature verification** (fails
  closed), bidirectional media WebSocket (`playAudio` / `clearAudio` /
  `checkpoint`), native `sendDTMF` over the media socket (a capability
  Twilio Media Streams lacks), voicemail drop, and pricing reconciled from
  the Plivo CDR. `Plivo` / `PlivoAdapter` exported from both package roots.
  `call(wait=True)` resolves correctly for Plivo too (AMD → voicemail,
  status callback → no_answer / busy / failed). Contributed by
  @amalshaji-plivo (#121).
- **Completion-aware outbound calls: `call(wait=True)` → `CallResult`
  (both SDKs).** An AI agent can now place a call and `await` its real
  outcome in one line instead of hand-wiring `on_call_end`/`onCallEnd` to
  an event and remembering to tear the server down. `wait` defaults to
  `False` (fire-and-forget, returns `None`/`void` — unchanged), so this is
  fully backward compatible. When `wait=True` the call resolves to a new
  `CallResult` (`call_id`, `outcome`, `status`, `duration_seconds`,
  `transcript`, `cost`, `metrics`); `outcome ∈ answered / voicemail /
  no_answer / busy / failed`, every value derived from a real carrier
  signal — answered/voicemail from the AMD result plus the media-stream
  end, no_answer/busy/failed from the carrier status callback (Twilio) or
  `call.hangup` cause (Telnyx) when the call never reaches media.
  `wait=True` requires an active server (raises `PatterConnectionError`
  otherwise) and is backstop-timeout bounded at `ring_timeout + 1800 s`.
  Python `libraries/python/getpatter/{models,client,server}.py`; TypeScript
  `libraries/typescript/src/{types,client,server,stream-handler}.ts`.
- **`async with Patter(...)` (Python) / `await using` via
  `[Symbol.asyncDispose]` (TypeScript) for guaranteed teardown.** Exiting
  the block always runs `disconnect()` — on the normal path and on
  exception — so a still-running TTS WebSocket can no longer keep the user
  billed after the SDK is done. `disconnect()` now also fails any in-flight
  `call(wait=True)` awaiters instead of letting them hang to the backstop.

- **Docs: new `Integrations → OpenClaw` page at
  [`docs.getpatter.com/integrations/openclaw`](https://docs.getpatter.com/integrations/openclaw).**
  Shows the `npx skills add patterai/skills` one-liner for OpenClaw users,
  documents the alternative `openclaw mcp set patter ...` path with both
  stdio and streamable-http transports, and surfaces the
  `before_tool_call.requireApproval` caveat (MCP tools bypass OpenClaw's
  native approval hooks, so outbound `patter__make_call` should be in
  `tools.elevated`). Added under a new `Integrations` group in the Home
  product nav (`docs/docs.json`).

- **Telnyx `call.recording.saved` webhook handler — Python parity with
  TypeScript.** `libraries/python/getpatter/server.py` now handles the
  Telnyx `call.recording.saved` Call Control event and logs the recording
  URL (mirrors `libraries/typescript/src/server.ts:1115`). Fallback order:
  `recording_urls.mp3` → `recording_urls.wav` → `public_recording_urls.mp3`
  → `public_recording_urls.wav`. Closes the parity gap that left the
  Python webhook silent on recording completion while the bridge already
  POSTed to `actions/record_start` / `actions/record_stop`.

- **README: prominent "Skills for Coding Agents" section linking to
  [`PatterAI/skills`](https://github.com/PatterAI/skills).** Top-nav anchor,
  callout quote with one-line install (`npx skills add patterai/skills`),
  table of the five skills, version pinning instructions, and link to the
  `skills.sh` page. Mirrors the pattern adopted by ElevenLabs, Vapi,
  Cartesia, Anthropic, and Coinbase (every vendor ships skills in a
  dedicated `<org>/skills` repo rather than inside the SDK).

### Changed

- **Agent Skills moved out of the SDK into a dedicated repository:
  [`PatterAI/skills`](https://github.com/PatterAI/skills).** The five
  `SKILL.md` files (and references) previously under `skills/` in this
  repo have been migrated to their own repository, matching the industry
  pattern (ElevenLabs `elevenlabs/skills`, Vapi `VapiAI/skills`, Cartesia
  `cartesia-ai/skills`, Anthropic `anthropics/skills`). The dedicated repo
  gives skills independent versioning, a cleaner `npx skills add
  patterai/skills` install path, and avoids growing the SDK clone size
  with non-runtime files. Skill content is unchanged — only the location
  moved. The previous install path `npx skills add patterai/patter` no
  longer resolves; use `npx skills add patterai/skills` instead.

- **READMEs (root + `libraries/python/` + `libraries/typescript/`) no
  longer claim "Recording is Twilio-only".** Telnyx recording parity is
  now documented consistently across all three READMEs. The Python and
  TypeScript stream bridges already drove `actions/record_start` /
  `actions/record_stop` against the Telnyx Call Control API when
  `recording=True` was passed; the README copy lagged behind the code.

### Fixed

- **Plivo + Pipeline + ElevenLabs produced garbled/static outbound audio
  (TypeScript).** `StreamHandler.isTtsOutputFormatNativeForCarrier()` only
  handled `twilio` / `telnyx`, so for `plivo` it returned `false` and the
  pipeline re-encoded the already-μ-law ElevenLabs output as if it were
  PCM16 — mangling it. Added the `plivo → ulaw_8000` native-format case
  (`libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts`). Python was unaffected
  (its Plivo bridge runs the handler with `for_twilio=True`).
- **`PatterTool` (Python) reported `cost_usd=None` and
  `duration_seconds=0.0` on every call.** The result builder probed the
  `on_call_end` `metrics` payload as a `dict`, but the live payload delivers
  a `CallMetrics` dataclass, so both fields were silently dropped. Rebuilt
  on the new `call(wait=True)` → `CallResult` path, which reads
  `cost.total` / `duration_seconds` as real attributes; the envelope now
  also carries `outcome`. `libraries/python/getpatter/integrations/patter_tool.py`.

- **Python: pipeline mode crashed immediately on stream start with
  `AttributeError: 'ClientConnection' object has no attribute 'closed'`
  (#111, #113).** Three WS-liveness checks
  (`libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py:2192` /
  `:2230` and
  `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/elevenlabs_ws_tts.py:453`)
  still used the legacy `websockets<11` `.closed` property, but Patter
  pins `websockets>=14,<16` in
  `libraries/python/pyproject.toml` where `.closed` was removed in v12.
  Promoted the existing `_is_parked_ws_alive` helper out of
  `stream_handler.py` into
  `libraries/python/getpatter/utils/ws.py` as `is_ws_alive`, and
  re-used it at every call site. Handles modern (`state`,
  `close_code`), legacy (`closed`), and unknown shapes; never defaults
  to "alive" on unknown shapes so a dead socket can't be handed to the
  live adapter. 8 new unit tests in
  `libraries/python/tests/test_utils_ws.py`. Thanks
  [@knowsuchagency](https://github.com/knowsuchagency).

- **Python: pipeline mode did not inject the built-in `transfer_call`
  / `end_call` tools into the `LLMLoop`, so pipeline agents could not
  initiate a handoff or hangup no matter what the system prompt said
  (#110, #115).** Realtime mode had been injecting both built-ins at
  `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py:997`
  (`agent_tools + [TRANSFER_CALL_TOOL, END_CALL_TOOL]`), but the
  pipeline path at
  `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py:2426` was passing
  through only the user-provided tools. Added
  `_augment_with_builtin_handoff_tools` that builds handler closures
  with the `(arguments, call_context)` signature expected by
  `ToolExecutor._invoke_handler` and wires them to the existing
  telephony-level `_transfer_fn` / `_hangup_fn` already attached to
  `PipelineStreamHandler`. Built-ins are skipped when the
  corresponding telephony fn is missing (keeps the non-telephony test
  harness path clean). Verified end-to-end against `gpt-4o-mini` on
  Twilio: caller says "transfer me", LLM emits
  `transfer_call({"number": "+1..."})`, `_twilio_transfer` fires, the
  call bridges. 6 new unit tests in
  `libraries/python/tests/test_pipeline_builtin_tools.py`. Thanks
  [@knowsuchagency](https://github.com/knowsuchagency).

- **TypeScript: pipeline mode missing built-in `transfer_call` /
  `end_call` tools — parity fix for #115.** Both `new LLMLoop(...)`
  call sites in `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts:1891` and
  `:1906` were passing `agent.tools` through unchanged; the built-ins
  shipped in `server.ts` (now exported as `TRANSFER_CALL_TOOL` /
  `END_CALL_TOOL`) were only injected into the Realtime path at
  `server.ts:374`. Added `augmentWithBuiltinHandoffTools` in
  `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts` that mirrors the Python
  helper: appends the two built-ins with handler closures that
  validate E.164 / default `reason` and dispatch to the existing
  telephony bridge methods (`this.deps.bridge.transferCall` /
  `endCall`). 8 new unit tests in
  `libraries/typescript/tests/pipeline-builtin-tools.test.ts`. Closes
  the parity gap surfaced by #115.

- **Docs: `docs/typescript-sdk/events.mdx` advertised the same
  non-existent `phone.events.on(PatterEventType.X, handler)` API as
  the Python events page — TypeScript parity fix for #114.** The TS
  `Patter` class never exposed an `.events` attribute; `EventBus` is
  instantiated per `StreamHandler`. Replaced the broken `EventBus`
  section with documentation of the APIs that actually exist on the
  TypeScript `Patter` class: **Speech-edge events** via the attribute
  setters (`onUserSpeechStarted` / `onUserSpeechEnded` /
  `onUserSpeechEos` / `onAgentSpeechStarted` / `onAgentSpeechEnded` /
  `onLlmToken` / `onAudioOut`, proxied to `this.speechEvents` at
  `libraries/typescript/src/client.ts:241-330`) and **Tool events via
  `onTranscript`** (tool invocations surface with `role === "tool"`,
  `tool_name`, `tool_args`, `tool_result` — payload defined at
  `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts:2988-3010`).

- **Docs: `docs/python-sdk/events.mdx` advertised a non-existent
  `phone.events.on(PatterEventType.X, handler)` API that crashed
  immediately with `AttributeError: 'Patter' object has no attribute

## 0.6.2 (2026-05-25)

### Added

- **`OpenAIRealtime2` / `OpenAIRealtime2Adapter` — Python GA Realtime API
  adapter (parity with TypeScript `OpenAIRealtime2` / `OpenAIRealtime2Adapter`
  in `libraries/typescript/src/engines/openai-2.ts` /
  `libraries/typescript/src/providers/openai-realtime-2.ts`).** The GA
  endpoint rejects the legacy `OpenAI-Beta: realtime=v1` header and speaks a
  different `session.update` wire shape (`output_modalities`, nested
  `audio.{input,output}` with MIME type strings, `session.type = "realtime"`).
  `OpenAIRealtime2Adapter` (in
  `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/openai_realtime_2.py`) subclasses
  `OpenAIRealtimeAdapter` and overrides `connect()`, `send_audio()`,
  `receive_events()`, and `send_first_message()` to speak the GA wire shape
  and perform bidirectional transcoding (mulaw 8 kHz ↔ PCM 24 kHz) required
  because the GA audio engine silently drops mulaw frames. `OpenAIRealtime2`
  engine marker (in `libraries/python/getpatter/engines/openai_realtime_2.py`)
  defaults to `gpt-realtime-2`. Both are exported from the top-level package:
  `from getpatter import OpenAIRealtime2, OpenAIRealtime2Adapter`. Wire up via
  `phone.agent(engine=OpenAIRealtime2(reasoning_effort="low"), ...)`.

### Changed

- **`OpenAIRealtime` default model changed from `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview`
  to `gpt-realtime-mini`** in
  `libraries/python/getpatter/engines/openai.py` and the `agent()` sentinel
  in `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py`. The beta
  `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview` model is deprecated on the GA endpoint as of
  2026-05. `gpt-realtime-mini` is the equivalent GA model. Existing callers
  that do not pin a model are automatically upgraded; callers that explicitly
  pass `model="gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview"` should migrate to
  `model="gpt-realtime-mini"` or switch to `OpenAIRealtime2`.

- **`phone.ready` and `phone.tunnel_ready` — serve-ready awaitables for
  outbound call orchestration (Python parity with TypeScript).** Both
  SDKs have always exposed these futures on the `Patter` class, but the
  Python docs showed the `asyncio.sleep(2)` anti-pattern instead of the
  correct `await phone.ready` pattern. Updated `docs/python-sdk/local-mode.mdx`
  to replace the `asyncio.sleep` example with `await phone.ready`, document
  the reject-on-failure guarantee, and add a note on `await phone.tunnel_ready`
  for hostname-only use cases. Added 15 unit tests covering lazy creation,
  idempotent access, resolution, rejection, idempotent resolve/reject guards,
  static-webhook pre-resolution, and post-`disconnect()` future recreation —
  mirroring the TS `client.test.ts` ready/tunnelReady coverage.

### Fixed

- **TypeScript `TwilioAdapter.generateStreamTwiml` now accepts an optional
  `parameters` argument (parity with Python `generate_stream_twiml`).** The
  static method previously ignored caller/callee context — passing
  `parameters: Record<string, string>` now emits
  `<Parameter name="..." value="..."/>` children of `<Stream>`, which is the
  only reliable path for pre-populating `start.customParameters` on the WS
  `start` frame (Twilio strips query-string params from the `<Stream url=...>`
  before the WebSocket handshake). The inbound webhook path in `server.ts`
  already inlined this TwiML directly; `generateStreamTwiml` is now brought
  into full API-surface parity so callers who construct TwiML via the adapter
  get the same behaviour. File: `libraries/typescript/src/providers/twilio-adapter.ts`.

- **Python outbound Twilio calls crashed with `TypeError: unexpected
  keyword argument 'StatusCallback'` (and similar for `Timeout`,
  `MachineDetection`, `AsyncAmd`).** `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py`
  was building the `extra_params` dict with PascalCase keys matching
  Twilio's REST wire protocol, but `twilio-python`'s
  `Client.calls.create(**kwargs)` only accepts snake_case — it
  translates internally to PascalCase before hitting the wire. Every
  outbound call using machine detection, `ring_timeout`, or status
  callbacks crashed at the SDK boundary (reported externally on
  zenn.dev for SDK 0.5.4). Fixed at source: all keys in `extra_params`
  are now snake_case (`status_callback`, `machine_detection`,
  `timeout`, `async_amd`, `async_amd_status_callback`,
  `status_callback_method`). Added a defensive PascalCase →
  snake_case normalisation pass in
  `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/twilio_adapter.py` so any
  future caller passing the wire-protocol spelling is auto-corrected
  before reaching the SDK. TypeScript SDK is unaffected — it sends raw
  `URLSearchParams` directly to Twilio's REST endpoint where
  PascalCase is the correct on-wire form. Regression locked in by
  `libraries/python/tests/unit/test_twilio_adapter_snake_case_kwargs.py`.

- **Phantom barge-in: cellular noise within 100 ms post-pickup was
  triggering self-cancellation of the prewarmed greeting.** Bumped
  `MIN_AGENT_SPEAKING_MS_BEFORE_BARGE_IN_NO_AEC` from 100 ms → 500 ms
  in `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts` and
  `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`. The 100 ms window was
  too tight — Twilio's media stream can emit background carrier noise
  (clicks, handshake tones, audio codec initialization) within the first
  100 ms after pickup, which the VAD read as speech-like energy and
  triggered a barge-in cancel. Extending to 500 ms allows the carrier
  audio path to stabilise before the agent's greeting becomes cancelable.

- **VAD telephony preset too sensitive: background room voices tripping
  barge-in.** `SileroVAD.forPhoneCall()` factory (TS) /
  `SileroVAD.for_phone_call` (Py) now raises activation threshold 0.5 →
  0.8 and deactivation threshold 0.35 → 0.65. The Silero model's
  upstream defaults (0.5 / 0.35) are tuned for studio audio; when
  running on 8 kHz telephony-band upsampled to 16 kHz, non-speech room
  noise (HVAC, background chatter, line buzz) was accumulating energy
  above the 0.5 threshold. Real-call acceptance testing showed natural
  pauses in the user's speech no longer trigger false barge-ins at the
  higher thresholds. Files: `libraries/typescript/src/providers/
  silero-vad.ts`, `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/silero_vad.py`.

- **`prewarmFirstMessage` default reverted to `false`.** An earlier
  0.6.2 attempt defaulted the flag to `true` in the factory; this
  proved incompatible with the above barge-in fixes. When the greeting
  is prewarmed but the phantom-barge-in (or VAD sensitivity) fires
  incorrectly on carrier-side noise, the agent cancels the cached
  audio without having spoken a character, leaving the caller in silence
  for 1–2 s while the agent recovers from the false cancel-and-restart
  cycle. Reverting to `prewarmFirstMessage: false` (TS) /
  `prewarm_first_message=False` (Py) at the factory level in
  `libraries/typescript/src/client.ts:Patter.agent()` and
  `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py:Patter.agent()`. Users who
  *want* the latency reduction should opt in explicitly: `phone.agent({
  prewarmFirstMessage: true })` — recommended for inbound calls and
  low-noise deployments. Realtime / ConvAI modes unaffected.

- **ElevenLabs HTTP TTS now auto-detects carrier and sets
  `outputFormat`.** Added `setTelephonyCarrier(carrierHint: string)`
  method to `ElevenLabsTTS` (TS) / `ElevenLabsTTS.set_telephony_carrier`
  (Py). When constructing `ElevenLabsTTS()` without an explicit
  `outputFormat` on Twilio, the factory `ElevenLabsTTS.forTwilio()`
  calls `setTelephonyCarrier("twilio")` to flip `outputFormat` to
  `"ulaw_8000"`, eliminating the per-frame resample + mulaw encode
  overhead. The plain constructor now only forwards `outputFormat` when
  the caller passed one explicitly — was unconditionally forwarding a
  `"pcm_16000"` fallback that disabled the carrier auto-flip logic.
  This matches the existing `ElevenLabsWebSocketTTS` carrier-aware
  behaviour. Files: `libraries/typescript/src/providers/elevenlabs-tts.ts`,
  `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/elevenlabs_tts.py`.

- **ElevenLabs WebSocket TTS now exposes `cancelActiveStream()` for
  barge-in cleanup.** The WebSocket variant held a live `activeStreamWs`
  reference but had no public way to abort it. `StreamHandler.cancelSpeaking`
  / `handleStop` / `handleWsClose` now call `tts.cancelActiveStream()`,
  unblocking the synthesizeStream generator's inner `await Promise<frame>`
  loop immediately when the carrier ends the call or the user barges in.
  Root cause of the post-hangup 30 s timeout error logs and stale token
  billing. Files: `libraries/typescript/src/providers/elevenlabs-ws-tts.ts`,
  `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/elevenlabs_ws_tts.py`.

- **Wrapper class TTS `outputFormat` field now conditional.** When an
  `ElevenLabsTTS` or `ElevenLabsWebSocketTTS` wrapper receives a carrier
  hint (e.g. Twilio), the wrapper's `outputFormat` field is set only if
  the caller passed it explicitly. Previous logic always forwarded a
  fallback value, which caused the carrier auto-flip to treat
  `outputFormat` as explicit and skip the optimization. Now the carrier
  auto-flip logic runs correctly: if no `outputFormat` was passed, the
  wrapper field remains `undefined`/`None` and the carrier-specific Twilio
  path activates naturally. Files: `libraries/typescript/src/tts/elevenlabs.ts`,
  `libraries/typescript/src/tts/elevenlabs-ws.ts`,
  `libraries/python/getpatter/tts/elevenlabs.py`.

- **`sendPacedFirstMessageBytes` timing rewritten: burst mode, no per-chunk
  sleep.** The original implementation paced each prewarm chunk with a
  `setTimeout` / `asyncio.sleep` of one chunk-equivalent of playout time
  (~40 ms for the 1280-byte default chunk). Combined with the
  `waitForMarkWindow` back-pressure await and JavaScript/asyncio timer
  jitter, effective delivery dropped BELOW Twilio's 8 kHz playout clock,
  producing repeated carrier-side underruns. Caller heard "slow, gravelly,
  and arriving more slowly than the rest". Twilio's docs (Media Streams →
  WebSocket Messages) state "media messages of any size" are "buffered
  and played in the order received" by the carrier-side media server — the
  carrier owns the playout clock. Rewrote to burst all prewarm chunks
  back-to-back with 20 ms frame granularity (no per-chunk sleep), matching
  the live-TTS streaming path that always worked. Per-chunk marks still
  emitted for fine-grained barge-in cut. Files: `libraries/typescript/src/
  stream-handler.ts`, `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`.

- **Mulaw native fast path in audio encode: skip resample + encode when
  TTS outputs `ulaw_8000` natively.** When pipeline mode detects
  `tts.outputFormat === "ulaw_8000"` on Twilio, `encodePipelineAudio`
  skips the resample (16 kHz → 8 kHz) + mulaw encode chain entirely and
  base64-encodes the raw bytes. Probed once in `initPipeline` and cached
  as `ttsOutputFormatNativeForCarrier`. Saves ~1–2 ms per 20 ms frame,
  cumulative ~5–10 % CPU when deployed at scale. Files:
  `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts`, `libraries/python/
  getpatter/stream_handler.py`.

- **`handleStop` / `handleWsClose` now abort in-flight LLM and cancel TTS
  immediately.** When the carrier ends a call or the StreamHandler is torn
  down, both paths now call `llmAbort()` (to unblock any pending LLM stream)
  and `tts.cancelActiveStream()` (to unblock any pending TTS stream).
  Prevents stale token billing and 30 s timeout error logs from post-hangup
  tasks trying to drain a closed WebSocket. Files: `libraries/typescript/src/
  stream-handler.ts`, `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`.

- **Python SDK parity sync for 2026-05-20 acceptance session.** All TS
  fixes landed during PSTN acceptance testing are now ported to Python:
  `ElevenLabsTTS.set_telephony_carrier` (HTTP variant, mirrors WS),
  `ElevenLabsWebSocketTTS.cancel_active_stream` + `_active_stream_ws`
  tracking, `_do_cancel_for_barge_in` / `cleanup` calling
  `cancel_active_stream` (duck-typed), `_is_tts_output_format_native_for_carrier`
  probe + `_tts_output_format_native_for_carrier` flag + audio-sender bypass
  in `PipelineStreamHandler.start`, `_spawn_prewarm_first_message` accepting
  `carrier=` and calling `set_telephony_carrier` before synthesis, and the
  `tts/elevenlabs.py` wrapper only forwarding `output_format` when explicitly
  passed. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/elevenlabs_tts.py`,
  `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/elevenlabs_ws_tts.py`,
  `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`,
  `libraries/python/getpatter/tts/elevenlabs.py`,
  `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py`.

- **Bidirectional race guard on `recordTurnComplete` / `recordTurnInterrupted`.**
  The original guard (added earlier in this release) was one-directional:
  a late `recordTurnComplete` after `recordTurnInterrupted` was dropped,
  but the inverse ordering (a late interrupt after a completed turn)
  could still overwrite a just-emitted turn record. The current caller
  paths can't produce that ordering, but the symmetric guard hardens
  the accumulator against future refactors. Both `recordTurnComplete`
  and `recordTurnInterrupted` now set `_turnAlreadyClosed`/`
  _turn_already_closed` and check it on entry. Same fix in
  `libraries/python/getpatter/services/metrics.py` and
  `libraries/typescript/src/metrics.ts`; regression tests added in both
  suites.

### Fixed

- **Pipeline metrics: `transcript.jsonl` rows after a barge-in carried an
  empty `user_text` even when the user had clearly spoken.** Root cause
  was a race between the two turn-close paths: a VAD-driven barge-in
  fired `record_turn_interrupted` / `recordTurnInterrupted` synchronously
  inside the audio handler and `_reset_turn_state` cleared
  `_turn_user_text`, while the in-flight pipeline LLM stream kept
  unwinding on its own task and eventually reached
  `record_turn_complete` / `recordTurnComplete` — which then pushed a
  second turn for the same logical exchange carrying `user_text=""`.
  Both SDKs now flip a `_turn_already_closed` / `_turnAlreadyClosed`
  guard on `record_turn_interrupted` and have `record_turn_complete`
  return `None` / `null` until the next `start_turn` re-arms the
  accumulator. `_emit_turn_metrics` / `emitTurnMetrics` were already
  null-safe, so the late call becomes a silent no-op end-to-end.
  Regression tests pinning the bargein → llmAbort → late-complete
  ordering live in `libraries/python/tests/test_metrics.py` and
  `libraries/typescript/tests/metrics.test.ts`. See
  `patter-sdk-acceptance/BUGS.md` (2026-05-05 entry).

- **CI: Security Audit workflow could not upload Bandit SARIF to the GitHub
  Security tab.** The `bandit` job in `.github/workflows/audit.yml` was
  failing on `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif` with `Resource not
  accessible by integration` because the job inherited the repo-default
  read-only `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions. Added an explicit
  `permissions: { contents: read, security-events: write }` block on the
  job so SARIF findings reach the Security tab as intended. Bumped the
  action from `@v3` to `@v4` to drop the deprecation warning ahead of the
  December 2026 sunset.

## 0.6.1 (2026-05-15)

### Fixed — `OpenAIRealtime2`: audio transcoding for Twilio + outbound chunking + VAD tuning (TypeScript only)

End-to-end audio support for `gpt-realtime-2` over Twilio. The GA endpoint
nominally accepts `audio/pcmu` (mulaw 8 kHz) in `session.update` but its
audio engine silently drops mulaw frames — `input_audio_buffer.commit`
reports *"buffer only has 0.00ms of audio"* even after several seconds
of valid mulaw appended, so the user's voice never reaches the model and
the model's response is generated as PCM-24 (regardless of the declared
output format) — Twilio plays raw PCM bytes interpreted as mulaw and the
caller hears nothing. Until OpenAI ships native g711 support on the GA
endpoint (community thread #1380750), we transcode on both directions
inside `OpenAIRealtime2Adapter`.

**Inbound (Twilio → model).** Override `sendAudio`:
- Decode mulaw → PCM-16 8 kHz (`mulawToPcm16`).
- Apply 2× gain to compensate for the reduced dynamic range of the
  decoded mulaw signal — telephony peaks land around ±8000 in PCM-16,
  the GA VAD is calibrated against studio audio peaking around ±16-24k.
- Direct 3× linear-interpolation upsample to 24 kHz with a one-sample
  carry across chunk boundaries (eliminates the DC step at every 20 ms
  Twilio frame boundary that previously kept the VAD pinned below
  threshold).
- Send `input_audio_buffer.append` with PCM-24 base64.
- `session.audio.input.format` is set to `{ type: "audio/pcm",
  rate: 24000 }` to match.

**Outbound (model → Twilio).** Wrap the audio-delta translation:
- Decode PCM-24 from `response.output_audio.delta`.
- Resample 24 k → 16 k → 8 k using two chained `StatefulResampler`
  instances. Direct 24 k → 8 k (one step) is available in
  `transcoding.ts` but uses only linear interpolation with no
  anti-alias filter; the two-step chain routes the signal through the
  16 k → 8 k path which carries a 5-tap FIR anti-alias filter,
  empirically the only configuration that produced audibly clean
  speech on the carrier leg.
- Encode PCM-8 → mulaw 8 kHz.
- Split the resulting mulaw into 20 ms (160-byte) slices and emit one
  synthetic `response.audio.delta` event per slice. Twilio's media
  pipeline expects ~20 ms frames; shipping one ~200-400 ms delta as a
  single frame stalls the playout scheduler and the caller hears
  either a silent gap then a burst, or nothing at all if Twilio drops
  the over-large frame.

**VAD tuning.** GA `server_vad` is too strict by default for
3×-upsampled telephony-band audio. We lower `threshold: 0.1` (from the
0.5 default) and raise `silence_duration_ms: 500` so phone-band speech
reliably triggers `speech_started` / `speech_stopped`.

**Engine wrapper:** `sendFirstMessage` continues to inject explicit
`output_modalities`, `audio.output.voice` and `reasoning.effort:"minimal"`
(see prior commit). The first-message audio path now also benefits from
the outbound transcoding + chunk-splitting changes — `firstMessage`
plays in the configured voice (`alloy`) at native cadence.

**Visibility bumps.** `OpenAIRealtimeAdapter` had a few more `private`
fields promoted to `protected` (`ws`, `armHeartbeatAndListener`,
`options`) so the subclass can install the wire-level shim and reuse
the parent's message dispatch unchanged.

**Known limitation.** The Twilio user's voice now reaches the GA model
audibly but the GA `server_vad` is still tuned for studio audio and the
caller side of the conversation requires a more aggressive workaround
(custom semantic VAD or carrier-side audio enhancement). Pipeline-mode
(STT + LLM + TTS) is the recommended production path for Twilio +
telephony in 0.6.1 until OpenAI ships native g711_ulaw on the GA
endpoint.

Files: `libraries/typescript/src/providers/openai-realtime-2.ts`,
`libraries/typescript/src/providers/openai-realtime.ts` (visibility
bumps only). Python parity remains a follow-up — `OpenAIRealtime2`
is still TS-only.

### Added — `OpenAIRealtime2` engine for `gpt-realtime-2` on the GA Realtime API (TypeScript only)

The 0.6.1 enum entry for `gpt-realtime-2` advertised parity with the existing
v1 Realtime adapter ("accepts the same v1 `session.update` wire shape so it
slots into the existing adapter without protocol changes"). That turned out
to be wrong: OpenAI promoted `gpt-realtime-2` to the **GA Realtime API**,
which (a) rejects the legacy `OpenAI-Beta: realtime=v1` header with
`invalid_model`, (b) requires `session.type === "realtime"` at the root of
`session.update`, (c) renames `modalities` → `output_modalities`, (d) nests
audio config under `session.audio.{input,output}` with MIME `type` strings
(`audio/pcmu`, `audio/pcma`, `audio/pcm`) instead of v1 enums (`g711_ulaw`,
`g711_alaw`, `pcm16`), and (e) renames the audio-delta event family from
`response.audio.*` / `response.audio_transcript.*` to
`response.output_audio.*` / `response.output_audio_transcript.*`. Going
through the v1 `OpenAIRealtime` engine with `model: "gpt-realtime-2"`
either timed out at `connect()` or completed the call with zero audio
forwarded to Twilio/Telnyx (events fell through to the no-op branch of
the v1 dispatcher).

New `OpenAIRealtime2` engine marker + `OpenAIRealtime2Adapter` subclass:

- **Separate engine marker.** `kind: "openai_realtime_2"`. The legacy
  `OpenAIRealtime` engine continues to serve `gpt-realtime`,
  `gpt-realtime-mini`, `gpt-realtime`, `gpt-4o-realtime-preview`, and
  `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview` against the v1-beta endpoint byte-for-byte
  unchanged; nothing in that path is touched.
- **`OpenAIRealtime2Adapter` extends `OpenAIRealtimeAdapter`.** Overrides
  only `connect()` (omits the beta header + sends the GA `session.update`
  payload) and `sendFirstMessage()` (uses `output_modalities`, re-injects
  `audio.output.voice` because the GA `response.create` does NOT inherit
  it from session, and forces `reasoning: { effort: "minimal" }` for the
  literal "say exactly X" greeting so TTFB is bounded by audio generation
  rather than the session-level reasoning tier). Everything else
  (`sendAudio`, `cancelResponse`, `sendText`, `sendFunctionResult`,
  heartbeat) is inherited unchanged.
- **WS-level event translation shim.** Wraps `ws.emit` to rewrite the
  incoming `type` field for the renamed events
  (`response.output_audio.{delta,done}` →
  `response.audio.{delta,done}`; same for `output_audio_transcript`)
  before the parent dispatcher sees the frame. Payloads are byte-identical
  so no further changes are needed in `StreamHandler`, metrics, or the
  dashboard.

Selection becomes opt-in: `phone.agent({ engine: new OpenAIRealtime2({ reasoningEffort: "low" }) })`.
Default model is `gpt-realtime-2`. Passing the GA marker to `Patter.agent`
auto-resolves `provider = "openai_realtime"` so the rest of the pipeline
(metrics, dashboard, cost line) treats the call identically to a v1
Realtime call.

Implementation: a handful of `private readonly` fields on the v1 adapter
(`apiKey`, `model`, `voice`, `instructions`, `tools`, `audioFormat`,
`options`, `ws`, `armHeartbeatAndListener`) were promoted to `protected`
so the subclass can reuse the heartbeat + message dispatch. No public
surface changed; both adapters still expose the exact same method set.

Files: `libraries/typescript/src/providers/openai-realtime-2.ts` (new,
~190 lines), `libraries/typescript/src/engines/openai-2.ts` (new, ~75
lines), `libraries/typescript/src/providers/openai-realtime.ts` (visibility
bumps only), `libraries/typescript/src/client.ts` (instanceof dispatch),
`libraries/typescript/src/server.ts` (`buildAIAdapter` selects the new
adapter when `engine.kind === "openai_realtime_2"`),
`libraries/typescript/src/types.ts` (engine union widened),
`libraries/typescript/src/index.ts` (re-export). Python parity is a
follow-up — `OpenAIRealtime2` is TS-only in this commit, the daily
`docs-feature-drift` job will flag it.

Verified end-to-end on a real Twilio PSTN call:
`Call ended: ... (13.6s, 3 turns, cost=$0.0255, p95 wait=642ms,
engine=openai_realtime_2)` — `firstMessage` plays in the configured voice
(`alloy`), language follows `systemPrompt`, audio flows both directions.

### Fixed — Dashboard MetricsPanel: Latency/Cost tabs render at the same height

Switching the MetricsPanel tabs between **Latency** and **Cost** caused a
visible vertical jump because each layout had a different natural height —
Latency (pipeline mode) renders 4 latency cards + a 3-row waterfall +
legend (~230 px), while Cost renders only the cost bar + 4-6 stack rows
(~180 px). The card outer height changed by ~50 px on every toggle.

Wrapped the tab content in a ``.metrics-panel-body`` container with
``min-height: 240px`` — sized to the tallest layout (pipeline Latency).
Both tabs now occupy exactly 321 px outer (body 240 px) and the tab
switch is purely a content swap.

Files touched:
  dashboard-app/src/components/MetricsPanel.tsx
  dashboard-app/src/styles/dashboard.css
  libraries/python/getpatter/dashboard/ui.html (resynced bundle)
  libraries/typescript/src/dashboard/ui.html (resynced bundle)

### Added — Dashboard: select & soft-delete calls (logs preserved as backup)

Operators can now select one or more calls in the dashboard call list and
remove them from the view + rolling metrics. The on-disk artefacts written
by ``CallLogger`` (``<log_root>/calls/YYYY/MM/DD/<call_id>/metadata.json``
and ``transcript.jsonl``) are intentionally NOT touched — they remain as a
durable backup that the operator can audit or re-import outside the
dashboard.

Behaviour:

- Soft-deleted ``call_id``s are excluded from ``get_calls`` / ``get_call`` /
  ``get_aggregates`` / ``get_calls_in_range`` / ``call_count``. The "Avg
  latency p95" and "Spend" cards recompute against the visible set, so the
  numbers always match what the operator sees in the table.
- Active calls are never deletable; a mid-call delete from the UI is
  silently skipped server-side so the live-transcript pane cannot be
  orphaned.
- The deleted set persists to ``<log_root>/.deleted_call_ids.json`` (atomic
  write). On process restart ``hydrate()`` reloads the set so previously
  deleted calls stay hidden, while the on-disk metadata is left intact.

API additions (parity across SDKs):

- ``DELETE /api/dashboard/calls/:call_id`` — remove one.
- ``POST /api/dashboard/calls/delete`` with ``{"call_ids": [...]}`` — batch.
- SSE event ``calls_deleted`` with payload ``{ "call_ids": [...] }`` so
  other tabs / external clients re-render immediately.

Store-level API:

- ``MetricsStore.delete_calls(call_ids)`` / ``deleteCalls(callIds)``
- ``MetricsStore.is_deleted(call_id)`` / ``isDeleted(callId)``
- ``MetricsStore.get_deleted_call_ids()`` / ``getDeletedCallIds()``

UI: the call table gains a checkbox column (live rows disabled). Selecting
≥1 row reveals a bulk-action bar with a clear-selection ghost button and a
peach destructive "Delete" button gated by an inline confirmation step that
explains the on-disk logs are preserved.

### Fixed — One-shot barge-in: VAD now reset between agent turns

After a successful barge-in on PSTN (no-AEC), subsequent barge-in attempts in the
same call silently failed. Root cause: PSTN echo of the agent's TTS played back
through the caller's phone speaker and returned through the mic, keeping
SileroVAD's smoothed probability above `deactivationThreshold` (0.35) for the
entire agent turn. The detector's `pubSpeaking` / `_pub_speaking` state stayed
`true` across turns, so the next user utterance never produced a fresh
`SILENCE → SPEECH` transition and `speech_start` never fired — barge-in
behaved as if it were "one shot".

Fix: added an optional `reset()` hook to the `VADProvider` interface
(TypeScript) / abstract base class (Python). `SileroVAD` implements it by
clearing the pending buffer, `pubSpeaking`, the speech/silence threshold
durations, the exponential smoothing filter, AND the ONNX model's RNN hidden
state + rolling context. `StreamHandler` invokes the reset in two places:

  1. **`beginSpeaking()` / `_begin_speaking()`** — every new agent turn starts
     with a clean VAD. The user's previous utterance has already been
     committed by STT so no audio is lost.
  2. **`endSpeakingWithGrace()` grace-timer fire** — natural turn end leaves
     VAD ready for the next spontaneous user utterance.

Failures in the optional `reset()` hook are logged and swallowed; a flaky
reset can never silently kill barge-in for the rest of the call.

Parity bonus: `_begin_speaking()` in Python now stamps `_first_audio_sent_at`
unconditionally (matching TypeScript `beginSpeaking()` since 2026-05-11). The
`is_first_message` parameter is kept for backward compat with callers but no
longer changes behaviour. Without this, a turn with a slow LLM was
un-interruptible for the entire LLM TTFT window because the barge-in gate
anchor stayed `None`.

### Fixed — Barge-in gate reduced 250 ms → 100 ms; suppressed speech flushed to STT on grace end

Two related barge-in defects on Twilio PSTN (no-AEC path):

1. **Gate too long.** `MIN_AGENT_SPEAKING_MS_BEFORE_BARGE_IN_NO_AEC` was 250 ms, blocking
   every `speech_start` VAD event for the first 250 ms after the agent began speaking.
   On short agent turns (< ~400 ms of audio) the gate expired only near the end of the
   turn, so the user's interruption was silently suppressed. Reduced to 100 ms, which is
   still enough to block PSTN echo loopback (~100–200 ms round-trip) while letting genuine
   user speech through on typical responses.

2. **Suppressed speech silently discarded.** When VAD fired `speech_start` during the
   agent's turn but barge-in was gate-suppressed, the user's audio accumulated in
   `inboundAudioRing` / `_inbound_audio_ring` but was never flushed. The ring is cleared
   at `beginSpeaking` / `_begin_speaking` (start of the next agent turn), so the user's
   words vanished without ever reaching STT. Added `suppressedSpeechPending` /
   `_suppressed_speech_pending` flag: set when speech_start is suppressed, cleared on
   barge-in or new turn, and on grace-timer expiry the ring is flushed to STT so the
   user's message is processed.

### Fixed — StatefulResampler FIR cold-start transient on first TTS chunk

`StatefulResampler` (TypeScript, `libraries/typescript/src/audio/transcoding.ts`) seeded
its 5-tap FIR history with `input[0]` on the first call. When ElevenLabs HTTP streaming
delivers an audio chunk that starts at non-zero amplitude, this produced a startup
transient on the resampled output — audible as a brief crackle at the beginning of the
first TTS message. Fixed: FIR history is now seeded with zeros (the correct initial
condition for a filter that has received no prior input), eliminating the transient.
No Python equivalent — Python uses `scipy.signal.resample_poly` which handles boundary
conditions internally.

### Fixed — First-message crackling on Twilio PSTN: streaming path now uses simple sendAudio

Root cause: the streaming first-message path (non-prewarm) was routing every
ElevenLabs HTTP chunk through `sendPacedFirstMessageBytes` /
`_send_paced_first_message_bytes`. That function was designed for the prewarm
case (one large pre-synthesised buffer) and resets drain+counter state on each
call. Applied per streaming chunk (~128 ms each), the drain+reset destroyed
mark back-pressure continuity and the per-sub-chunk playout sleep slowed
delivery below Twilio's playout rate, causing periodic buffer underruns
(crackling on the first message only). Subsequent LLM responses used the
simpler `synthesizeSentence` / `_synthesize_sentence` path (plain `sendAudio`)
and never crackled, confirming the fix direction.

Fix: the streaming first-message path now uses the same plain
`encodePipelineAudio + sendAudio + markFirstAudioSent` pattern as subsequent
turns. The prewarm path (pre-synthesised buffer) is unchanged and still uses
`sendPacedFirstMessageBytes` / `_send_paced_first_message_bytes` because that
buffer can be several seconds long and needs mark-gated pacing. Files:
`libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts`,
`libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`.

### Changed — Cerebras usage-chunk fallback: INFO-once + DEBUG per iteration (Python + TypeScript parity)

The char/4 fallback billing path in `services/llm_loop.py` /
`src/llm-loop.ts` previously emitted `logger.warning` /
`getLogger().warn` on every tool-loop iteration when the upstream
provider stream did not include a `usage` chunk. On Cerebras (the
common case for this fallback), a multi-tool turn could log 5-10
identical WARN lines for the same call — drowning real warnings.

Replaced with: first fallback in the call → INFO (so operators
still see it once with the full diagnostic context — `provider`,
`model`, `input_chars`, `output_chars`, `est_input_tokens`,
`est_output_tokens`); subsequent iterations → DEBUG with the
iteration index and a per-LLMLoop `_usage_missing_count` /
`_usageMissingCount` total so the volume is still visible at
DEBUG level. No behavioural change — billing still uses char/4
estimation. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/services/llm_loop.py`,
`libraries/typescript/src/llm-loop.ts`.

### Changed — Krisp VIVA TypeScript scaffold: refreshed unavailability message (2026-05)

The `KrispVivaFilter` constructor in
`libraries/typescript/src/providers/krisp-filter.ts` already throws
with guidance because Krisp does not publish a Node.js server SDK as
of 2026-05. Refreshed the message to include the verification date,
explicitly distinguish "server Node SDK" from existing browser/RN
third-party wrappers, and note that those wrappers (browser WASM and
mobile client variants) are scoped to local microphone capture and
cannot process Patter's server-side PCM/mulaw audio. Python
`KrispVivaFilter` and TS `DeepFilterNetFilter` remain the only
shipped paths. No code behaviour change.

### Fixed — Barge-in gate regression test: prewarmed first message must remain interruptible

Locked in with parity tests on both SDKs that `_stream_prewarm_bytes` / `streamPrewarmBytes` open the barge-in gate (`_first_audio_sent_at` / `firstAudioSentAt`) once the first chunk reaches the wire. The gate was already opened by `_begin_speaking(is_first_message=True)` ahead of streaming, but a future refactor of the `_begin_speaking` path could regress the prewarm path silently — the per-chunk `_mark_first_audio_sent` call inside the streaming loop is the last line of defence and now has explicit coverage in `test_stream_prewarm_bytes_opens_barge_in_gate_on_first_chunk` (Python) and `opens the barge-in gate by stamping firstAudioSentAt after the first chunk` (TypeScript).

Files: `libraries/python/tests/test_prewarm.py`, `libraries/typescript/tests/unit/prewarm.test.ts`.

### Fixed — `ElevenLabsWebSocketTTS.adopt_websocket` leaked the previous parked WS when called outside an event loop

`ElevenLabsWebSocketTTS.adopt_websocket` (Python) closed any previously parked WS handle via `asyncio.create_task(prev.ws.close())`. When invoked from a sync context with no running event loop — e.g. cleanup hooks fired from `__del__`, atexit handlers, or signal-driven teardown — the `create_task` call raised `RuntimeError` which the code silently swallowed with a bare `except RuntimeError: pass`, leaking the socket FD. ElevenLabs would eventually close the remote side after the inactivity timeout, but the FD on our side stayed allocated until process exit.

The fix keeps the async fast path when a loop is running, and falls back to a best-effort synchronous `transport.close()` (non-blocking, skips the WS close handshake but cleans up the file descriptor) when no loop is available. A warning log is emitted on the fallback path so the FD-leak symptom shifts from "silent" to "logged".

The TypeScript counterpart `adoptWebSocket` is unaffected — `ws.close()` from the `ws` package is synchronous so the same scenario doesn't reach an analogous error branch.

Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/elevenlabs_ws_tts.py`, `libraries/python/tests/unit/test_elevenlabs_ws_tts.py` (new `TestAdoptWebSocketCleanup`).

### Added — `patter.*` OTel attribute helpers in the TypeScript SDK (parity with Python)

The Python SDK ships `record_patter_attrs`, `patter_call_scope`, and `attach_span_exporter` (in `getpatter.observability.attributes`) for stamping `patter.cost.*` / `patter.latency.*` span attributes and wiring an OTel `SpanExporter` into the tracer provider. The TypeScript SDK previously had no equivalent surface — calling code that wanted to record those attributes had to no-op manually or import `@opentelemetry/api` directly, which broke cross-SDK parity per `.claude/rules/sdk-parity.md`.

This change ports the helpers to TypeScript as no-ops by default. When `PATTER_OTEL_ENABLED` is unset or `@opentelemetry/api` is not installed, every helper is a fast no-op, so existing call sites stay zero-cost. Available as:

```ts
import {
  recordPatterAttrs,
  patterCallScope,
  attachSpanExporter,
  DEFAULT_SIDE,
} from 'getpatter/observability';
```

Semantic mapping (1:1 with Python):

- `recordPatterAttrs(attrs)` ↔ `record_patter_attrs(attrs)`
- `patterCallScope({ callId, side }, fn)` ↔ `patter_call_scope(call_id=..., side=...)` (the JS form takes an async callback because JS lacks `with`-style context managers; the closure is the scope body)
- `attachSpanExporter(patterInstance, exporter, { side })` ↔ `attach_span_exporter(patter, exporter, side=...)`

Files: `libraries/typescript/src/observability/attributes.ts` (new), `libraries/typescript/src/observability/index.ts` (re-exports), `libraries/typescript/tests/unit/observability-attributes.test.ts` (new).

### Fixed — `EOUMetrics` field semantics + unit parity between Python and TypeScript SDKs

The Python implementation in `libraries/python/getpatter/services/metrics.py:_emit_eou_metrics` had `end_of_utterance_delay` and `transcription_delay` swapped relative to the TypeScript counterpart, and emitted them in seconds while the TypeScript SDK and the rest of the observability surface (`ttfb_ms`, `turn_ms`) use milliseconds. The dashboard, EventBus subscribers and any downstream exporter consuming both SDKs would have seen the two fields disagree by a factor of 1000× AND swapped — silently corrupting end-of-utterance latency dashboards on cross-SDK fleets.

The convention is now uniform across both SDKs (locked in by tests):

- `end_of_utterance_delay` / `endOfUtteranceDelay` = `stt_final − vad_stopped` (milliseconds)
- `transcription_delay` / `transcriptionDelay` = `turn_committed − vad_stopped` (milliseconds)
- `on_user_turn_completed_delay` / `onUserTurnCompletedDelay` = pipeline hook execution time (milliseconds)

Negative deltas from clock skew or out-of-order timestamps are now clamped to `0` on both sides (the TypeScript side already did this; Python now does too).

Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/services/metrics.py`, `libraries/python/getpatter/observability/metric_types.py` (docstring), `libraries/python/tests/test_metrics.py` (new `TestEOUMetricsEmission`), `libraries/typescript/tests/unit/metrics.test.ts` (new `emitEouMetrics field semantics` block).

### Fixed — Barge-in bug bundle: 6.8s latency outliers, double-talk dispatch, stale anchors, firstMessage uninterruptible (Python + TypeScript parity)

Real PSTN test (round 10f, 11 turns with user-initiated interruptions) surfaced four correlated bugs in the barge-in pipeline that the previous strategy work in 0.6.1 did not cover. Investigation report (`/private/tmp/.../a6fae04df253294f2.output`) traced all four to anchor mismanagement around the interrupt boundary plus an over-aggressive VAD threshold.

**Bug 1 — endpoint_ms == stt_ms == 6818 ms (dishonest p95 outliers).** `recordSttComplete` was fabricating `_endpointSignalAt = _sttComplete` when no legitimate VAD `speech_end` had fired, producing a synthetic anchor that then made `endpoint_ms = _turnCommittedMono − _turnStart` (the entire turn duration). Fix: never fake the anchor; let `endpoint_ms` be `undefined` on the affected turn and increment a `_endpointSignalMissingCount` counter for observability. Added a 100 ms post-barge-in gate (`_lastBargeinAt`): the next turn's `endpoint_ms` / `stt_ms` are dropped from the percentile distribution since post-barge-in anchors are inherently noisy. Files: `libraries/typescript/src/metrics.ts:412-422,538-549,572-596,870-984`, `libraries/python/getpatter/services/metrics.py:289,362,395,696`.

**Bug 2 — double-talk: agent answered the 1st sentence while user said the 2nd.** Deepgram emits `is_final` on any pause > a few ms; the SDK dispatched LLM immediately. Two fixes ship together:

1. **Bumped Silero `minSilenceDuration` default `0.1` → `0.4` s**. The previous 100 ms threshold fired VAD `speech_end` on natural inter-sentence pauses (typically 200-400 ms), which then prematurely finalised the user turn at the STT layer. 0.4 s is the industry-standard default for telephony agents: bridges intra-utterance pauses without delaying single-sentence turns by more than the natural conversational gap. Files: `libraries/typescript/src/providers/silero-vad.ts:366-378`, `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/silero_vad.py:125`.
2. **Synchronous STT-final → LLM dispatch (no debounce)**. An earlier 400 ms debounce attempt (`_scheduleTurnCommit` / `_runDeferredTurnCommit`) was prototyped and rolled back before release: the partial-transcript reschedule branch overwrote the dispatched FINAL text with the latest partial, silently dropping entire user turns during slow-LLM windows. Verified on real PSTN (round 10k, gpt-5-nano: 3 of 5 user turns dropped). The shipped behaviour dispatches on `is_final` immediately; when Deepgram emits two close-together finals like `"What's the"` then `"What's the best?"`, the SDK answers both (benign double-answer) instead of dropping the first (catastrophic). Tracked future improvements documented internally — options include raising Deepgram `endpointingMs` per-agent, queue-cancel semantics, and sentence-segment merge in `commitTranscript`. Files: `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts` (inline dispatch restored), `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py` (`_dispatch_turn` called inline from `_stt_loop`).

**Bug 3 — anchors stale after strategy-confirmed barge-in.** `runBargeInCancel` cleared anchors via `_resetTurnState()` but never re-anchored to the next legitimate VAD `speech_start`; the next turn either inherited stale anchors or anchored to the first inbound audio byte (adding ~250 ms ring-buffer delay to every post-barge-in turn). Added `anchorUserSpeechStart()` calls in three places: after `recordTurnInterrupted` in `runBargeInCancel`, and on the pending-barge-in timeout path. Also `_resetTurnState` now resets `_initialTtfbEmitted` (TS) / `_initial_ttfb_emitted` + `_llm_ttfb_emitted` + `_tts_ttfb_emitted` (Py) so EventBus TTFB re-fires after barge-in when `reportOnlyInitialTtfb=true`. Files: `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts:2034-2058`, `libraries/typescript/src/metrics.ts:846-867`, Python mirrors.

**Bug 4 — firstMessage was uninterruptible by VAD for 300-800 ms.** `canBargeIn()` gates on `firstAudioSentAt !== null`, but that field was only stamped when the first audio chunk arrived from the TTS provider — meaning the 250 ms anti-flicker timer didn't start until the user had already missed the TTFB window. Fix: `beginSpeaking(isFirstMessage=true)` now stamps `firstAudioSentAt = Date.now()` synchronously, so the gate timer runs in parallel with TTS TTFB. The firstMessage TTS loop already breaks on `!this.isSpeaking`, so user speech now propagates cancellation correctly. Files: `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts:357,1477`, `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py:3187,2043`.

### Changed — Dashboard percentile threshold lowered 5 → 2 turns

`LatencyPanel` and `MetricsPanel` displayed `—` for `p50` / `p95` until a call had ≥5 turns. On most PSTN calls (typically 4-7 turns) the detail pane showed dashes while the call-list `P95 LATENCY` column already showed a real number via `avg` fallback — confusing for users comparing the two surfaces. Lowered to 2 turns so the detail pane matches the list column. With n=2 the percentile is statistically thin but consistent with what the list shows.

Files: `dashboard-app/src/components/LatencyPanel.tsx:12`, `dashboard-app/src/components/MetricsPanel.tsx:76,127`. Bundle synced to `libraries/{typescript,python}/.../dashboard/ui.html` via `dashboard-app/scripts/sync.mjs`.

### Added — Krisp VIVA noise-suppression scaffold for TypeScript SDK

Mirrors the Python `KrispVivaFilter` API at `libraries/typescript/src/providers/krisp-filter.ts` for cross-SDK parity. Class signature accepts the same options (`modelPath`, `noiseSuppressionLevel`, `frameDurationMs`, `sampleRate`) but throws at construction time with guidance — Krisp does not publish an official Node.js SDK as of 2026-05. Opt-in, proprietary, license required, no default-on. Patter ships only the interface; users supply SDK + `.kef` model.

Available paths today:
1. **Python SDK**: `from getpatter.providers.krisp_filter import KrispVivaFilter` — fully implemented (existed prior to this change, unmodified). Requires `pip install getpatter[krisp]` + `KRISP_VIVA_SDK_LICENSE_KEY` + `KRISP_VIVA_FILTER_MODEL_PATH`.
2. **TypeScript today**: `new DeepFilterNetFilter({ modelPath })` from `getpatter` — community ONNX export, no license. `KrispVivaFilter` throws until a Node binding is available.

New top-level exports from `getpatter`: `KrispVivaFilter`, `KrispVivaFilterOptions`, `KrispSampleRate`, `KrispFrameDuration`, `DeepFilterNetFilter`, `DeepFilterNetOptions`. The TS scaffold closes when an official Krisp Node SDK ships or a community NAPI/WASM binding becomes available.

### Fixed — Dashboard live SSE update wiped transcripts + latency from prior calls

When a new call started, the live SSE refresh in
`dashboard-app/src/hooks/useDashboardData.ts:103` rebuilt the entire
calls array from `mergeCalls(active, recent)` without consulting the
previous state. If the new payload had any field as undefined — common
when the server-side `MetricsStore.updateCallStatus` writes a synthetic
"terminal" record with `metrics: undefined` ahead of the true
`recordCallEnd` — the prior call lost its transcripts and latency p50/
p95 in the UI. Added `mergeCallPreserving(prev, next)` that does
`next.field ?? prev.field` per critical field, masking the lossy
secondary records server-side. The SDK-side double-write race in
`libraries/typescript/src/dashboard/store.ts:134-186` is flagged with a
TODO for 0.6.2.

### Changed — `elevenlabs.TTS` facade now defaults to WebSocket streaming (Python + TypeScript parity)

Industry best practice for telephony agents is a long-lived WS connection — every other Patter STT adapter (Deepgram nova-3, Cartesia ink-whisper, Whisper streaming, AssemblyAI) already runs on persistent WS. ElevenLabs TTS was the outlier: the default `elevenlabs.TTS()` facade opened a fresh HTTP POST per sentence (TLS handshake, DNS, full request setup repeated on every turn), producing measured TTFB p50 ~265 ms on PSTN — vs ElevenLabs's published server-side TTFT of ~75 ms. The gap was almost entirely HTTP setup, not synthesis.

Flipped both SDKs to extend the WebSocket class (`_ElevenLabsWebSocketTTS` / `_ElevenLabsTTSWebSocket`) by default. Expected TTFB p50 drop: ~265 ms → ~80-100 ms (after the first turn pays one handshake; turn 2+ reuses the open WS).

- TS: `libraries/typescript/src/tts/elevenlabs.ts` — `class TTS extends _ElevenLabsWebSocketTTS`. Default `voiceId="EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL"`, `modelId="eleven_flash_v2_5"`, `outputFormat="pcm_16000"`, `autoMode=true`. `providerKey` flipped `"elevenlabs"` → `"elevenlabs_ws"`. `for_twilio`/`for_telnyx` signatures unchanged.
- Py: `libraries/python/getpatter/tts/elevenlabs.py` — `class TTS(_ElevenLabsWebSocketTTS)` with matching defaults. `chunk_size` kept as tolerated-but-ignored kwarg (the WS path doesn't use it) to avoid breaking pinned callers.
- Compatibility aliases preserved: `elevenlabs_ws.TTS` (TS + Py) now re-exports from `elevenlabs.TTS`. `ElevenLabsWebSocketTTS` top-level symbol unchanged.

**REST opt-out** — new top-level export `ElevenLabsRestTTS` in both SDKs. Use when:
- The free / starter tier (WS requires Pro plan; the WS class raises `PLAN_REQUIRED_MSG` directing callers to `ElevenLabsRestTTS`).
- The `eleven_v3` model (HTTP-only — the WS class rejects it at construction with the same redirect).

```ts
// TS
import { ElevenLabsRestTTS } from "getpatter";
const tts = new ElevenLabsRestTTS(process.env.ELEVENLABS_API_KEY!);
```
```python
# Python
from getpatter import ElevenLabsRestTTS
tts = ElevenLabsRestTTS(api_key=os.environ["ELEVENLABS_API_KEY"])
```

Dashboard label-prettifier extended in `dashboard-app/src/components/{CostPanel,MetricsPanel}.tsx` — `titleCase()` regex now strips `_ws` / `_rest` transport suffixes in addition to `_stt` / `_tts` / `_llm` role suffixes. `"elevenlabs_ws"` now renders as "Elevenlabs" without the suffix bleed into UI. Repeated `+` handles compound suffixes (`"cartesia_tts_ws"` → `"Cartesia"`).

Provider error messages in `providers/elevenlabs-ws-tts.{ts,py}` updated: `payment_required` and `eleven_v3` rejections now direct users to `ElevenLabsRestTTS` (was `ElevenLabsTTS` — which is now the WS facade itself, making the previous text recursive).

Tests: 173 Python (was 170) + 95 TS (was 93) pass. 1 REST-specific assertion in `test_tts_facade_language.py` migrated to `ElevenLabsRestTTS` (the `chunk_size == 4096` default). 2 new tests each side verify the flip semantics and the opt-out is not aliased.

Acceptance matrix: 25 duplicate `outbound-*-elevenlabs-ws.ts` scenarios removed (now functionally identical to `outbound-*-elevenlabs.ts`). Added 1 explicit regression `outbound-deepgram-cerebras-elevenlabs-rest.ts` to keep the REST path exercised. `_manifest.json` updated (78 entries).

Migration: **0 code changes** for callers using the default — they automatically benefit from the latency drop. **1-line import rename** for callers who deliberately want HTTP REST (`ElevenLabsTTS` → `ElevenLabsRestTTS`).

### Fixed — Console "Call ended" summary log p95 used `total_ms`, not `agent_response_ms` (Python + TypeScript parity)

The single-line `[PATTER] Call ended: ... p95=Xms` log emitted by `stream_handler.ts` (TS) and `telephony/{twilio,telnyx}.py` (Py) at the end of every call read `latency_p95.total_ms` — the round-trip duration that **includes** how long the user spoke (`user_speech_duration_ms`), not the system-controlled wait time. The metrics module itself flags this in `metrics.ts:85-89`: "Unlike `total_ms` (which spans the user's entire utterance and therefore grows with how long the user spoke), `agent_response_ms` isolates the system-controlled latency."

The dashboard already shows the correct field — `agent_response_ms` — under the **"p95 wait"** tile (`LatencyPanel.tsx:48`, `mappers.ts:221`). The console log diverged: a 51.6 s, 7-turn call where the user spoke ~1.2 s/turn printed `p95=2577ms` while the dashboard showed `p95 wait=1361ms` for the same call. The 1361 ms is the genuine user-perceived wait; the 2577 ms confused users into thinking the SDK was slow.

Switched both SDKs to read `latency_p95.agent_response_ms` (fallback `total_ms` for legacy short calls where the percentile isn't computed) and renamed the label to **`p95 wait=Xms`** to match the dashboard tile word-for-word. Files: `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts:2810-2820`, `libraries/python/getpatter/telephony/twilio.py:657-680`, `libraries/python/getpatter/telephony/telnyx.py:792-810`.

### Fixed — Telnyx pricing direction-aware: inbound 2× over-bill resolved

Audited against https://telnyx.com/pricing/elastic-sip (verified
2026-05-11). The previous flat `"telnyx": $0.007/min` over-billed
inbound calls by 2× ($0.0035 real) and approximately matched outbound
($0.005-0.009 range). Split into two entries:
- `telnyx_inbound`: $0.0035/min (US local termination)
- `telnyx_outbound`: $0.007/min (Pay-As-You-Go mid-range)
The legacy `telnyx` key is preserved at $0.007 for backward-compat with
users who override `pricing={"telnyx": {...}}` and don't know direction.
Billing granularity confirmed per-minute (not per-second as previous
internal docs claimed). Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/pricing.py`,
`libraries/typescript/src/pricing.ts`. Tests added at
`libraries/python/tests/test_pricing.py`,
`libraries/typescript/tests/pricing.test.ts`.

### Fixed — Python Twilio STT cost 4× over-bill (sample rate / bytes-per-sample mismatch)

`libraries/python/getpatter/telephony/twilio.py` configured the metrics
STT format as `(sample_rate=8000, bytes_per_sample=1)` (mulaw 8 kHz),
but `stream_handler.py` already decodes the inbound mulaw to PCM16
@ 16 kHz before feeding bytes to `metrics.add_stt_audio_bytes()`. With
the inverted format, every 60 s of real audio was reported as 240 s and
billed 4× the true cost ($0.0192 instead of $0.0048 against Deepgram
Nova-3 at $0.0048/min). TypeScript was unaffected (default 16000/2 was
never overridden); Python Telnyx was unaffected (already configured 16000/2).
Fix: `configure_stt_format(sample_rate=16000, bytes_per_sample=2)` in
the Twilio adapter, plus a regression test asserting 1.92 MB of PCM16
bytes = 60 s of audio. Customers were over-billed; refund window TBD.

### Fixed — Dashboard "−$X cached" badge dead for Realtime prompt-caching savings

The SDK emits `cost.llm_cached_savings` (Realtime / Anthropic prompt
caching discount) but `dashboard-app/src/lib/mappers.ts:computeCost()`
never read it, so `Call.cost.cached` was always undefined and the badge
in `CostPanel.tsx:64` never rendered. Wired the field through
`api.ts:CallCost` (added `llm_cached_savings?: number` + `parseCost`)
and the mapper now populates `result.cached`. The "−$0.00X cached" line
now appears next to the LLM cost row whenever a Realtime call has any
cached-token savings.

### Changed — LLM usage-chunk char/4 fallback log bumped DEBUG → WARN (Python + TypeScript)

The 0.6.1 char/4 fallback (added when Cerebras was observed dropping
the `usage` chunk on some streams) was logging at DEBUG, so silent-zero
incidents only showed up in dev runs. Bumped to WARN in
`libraries/python/getpatter/services/llm_loop.py` and
`libraries/typescript/src/llm-loop.ts` so production observability
surfaces it. Message: "LLM usage chunk missing from {provider}/{model};
estimating output_tokens=N via char/4 fallback".

### Fixed — Deepgram STT pricing reflected legacy standard rate, not the current PAYG promo (Python + TypeScript parity)

Audited against https://deepgram.com/pricing (verified 2026-05-11). Deepgram is currently running a "Limited-time promotional rates on streaming" tier that customers actually pay today; the prior $0.0077/min Nova-3 figure was the launch-era standard rate that has been struck through on the public page.

| Model | Old (USD / min) | New (USD / min) | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| `nova-3` (default) | $0.0077 | **$0.0048** | over 60% |
| `nova-3-multilingual` | $0.0092 | **$0.0058** | over 58% |
| `flux` (added) | — | **$0.0065** | Flux English; new event-driven STT (2026) |
| `flux-english` (added) | — | **$0.0065** | alias of `flux` |
| `flux-multilingual` (added) | — | **$0.0078** | new |
| `nova-2`, `nova`, `whisper-*` | unchanged | unchanged | legacy / non-Nova-3 tiers |

Dropped the `"deepgram"` provider-level default from $0.0077 to $0.0048 (Nova-3 monolingual is the Patter default model). A 25-minute call against the default would have reported $0.1925 in `cost.stt` instead of the actual $0.12 — over-reporting by ~60%. Customers were never undercharged; the dashboard line item was wrong. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/pricing.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/pricing.ts`. Tests updated at `libraries/python/tests/test_pricing.py`, `libraries/typescript/tests/pricing.test.ts`, and the matching soak tests. Revisit when Deepgram removes the promo banner.

### Fixed — ElevenLabs pricing table overcharged Flash 20% and Multilingual v2 / v3 by 80-200% (Python + TypeScript parity)

Audited against the canonical public API pricing page at https://elevenlabs.io/pricing/api (verified 2026-05-11). The per-1K-character API/overage rate is flat across all plan tiers (Free → Business); only the included character bundle varies. Patter's 2026-05 table reflected legacy Creator-plan overage figures and a launch-era v3 quote that have since been consolidated.

| Model | Old (USD / 1K chars) | New (USD / 1K chars) | Notes |
|-------|----------------------|----------------------|-------|
| `eleven_flash_v2_5` | $0.06 | **$0.05** | Patter default; was 20% over |
| `eleven_turbo_v2_5` | $0.05 | $0.05 | unchanged ✓ |
| `eleven_multilingual_v2` | $0.18 | **$0.10** | was 80% over |
| `eleven_v3` | $0.30 | **$0.10** | grouped with multilingual v2 on the public page; was 200% over |
| `eleven_monolingual_v1` (legacy) | $0.18 | **$0.10** | matches multilingual tier |

Also dropped the `"elevenlabs"` / `"elevenlabs_ws"` provider-level default from $0.06 to $0.05 (flash_v2_5 is the Patter default model). A 5-turn call against the default would have reported $0.000060/char × N chars instead of the actual $0.000050/char — over-reporting LLM-bill-equivalent TTS cost by 20%. Customers were never undercharged, but the dashboard cost line was wrong. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/pricing.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/pricing.ts`. Tests updated at `libraries/python/tests/test_pricing.py`, `libraries/typescript/tests/pricing.test.ts`, plus the matching soak tests.

### Fixed — Dashboard cost labels leaked provider-key suffix (`Cartesia_stt STT` → `Cartesia STT`)

The Cost panel's `titleCase()` helper rendered raw SDK `provider_key` literals (e.g. `cartesia_stt`, `elevenlabs_tts`) which the SDK uses to disambiguate provider-class lookups. The `_stt` / `_tts` / `_llm` suffix is internal noise: the panel already shows the role label next to the swatch ("STT", "TTS", "LLM"), so the suffix duplicated context and produced strings like "Cartesia_stt STT · ink-whisper". Stripped the suffix in both `dashboard-app/src/components/CostPanel.tsx` and `dashboard-app/src/components/MetricsPanel.tsx` `titleCase()` so labels render "Cartesia STT · ink-whisper" / "Elevenlabs TTS · eleven_flash_v2_5".

### Fixed — Phantom `speech_start` during agent TTS contaminated turn anchors (Python + TypeScript parity)

A real PSTN call surfaced `user_speech_duration_ms` of 5-7 seconds for utterances the caller actually spoke in ~1 second. Forensic timeline reconstruction (`releases/0.6.0/typescript/call-logs/.../CA6d7fc612...`) pinned the contamination to two bug classes uncovered by parallel-agent audit (forensic + architect + adversarial + provider-reviewer agreement):

1. **Phantom-speech-start anchor contamination** — `StreamHandler` called `metrics.start_turn_if_idle()` on EVERY VAD `speech_start` event, including the ones suppressed during the per-turn warmup gate (`_can_barge_in() == False`). With AEC enabled this is a ~1 s window; without AEC it is the 250 ms anti-flicker margin. Background noise / echo / agent self-loopback during that window emitted a `speech_start` that was correctly suppressed for the barge-in path BUT silently stamped `_turn_start` at the bleed-through instant. The legitimate user `speech_start` that fired seconds later then no-op'd because `start_turn_if_idle` only acts when `_turn_start is None`. Result: `user_speech_duration_ms = (endpoint_signal_at − stale_turn_start) * 1000`, often 5-7 s.

2. **Stale `_endpoint_signal_at` across dropped final transcripts** — when a final transcript arrived but `commitTranscript` / `_commit_transcript` returned False (dedup window / rejected barge-in / `afterTranscribe` veto, e.g. the "Okay." swallow on a strategy-pending barge-in), the previously-stamped VAD-end anchor was never cleared. The NEXT legitimate utterance inherited that stale anchor, so its `endpoint_ms` measured the silence gap between the dropped utterance and the real one.

Both classes fixed with a single new metrics primitive and two call-site swaps:

- **`anchor_user_speech_start()` (Python) / `anchorUserSpeechStart()` (TypeScript)** — Pipecat-style "every legitimate VAD `speech_start` re-anchors the turn pre-commit". Resets `_turn_start`, `_endpoint_signal_at`, `_vad_stopped_at`, `_stt_final_at`, `_stt_complete`, `_llm_first_token`, and the TTFB-emitted guard. No-ops once `_turn_committed_mono` is set (post-commit barge-ins follow the existing `record_turn_interrupted` path). Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/services/metrics.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/metrics.ts`.

- **`stream_handler.py` / `stream-handler.ts` VAD `speech_start` handler** — explicit `phantom_suppressed` boolean gates ALL metrics state mutation: suppressed events log only, legitimate events call `anchor_user_speech_start()` instead of the old `start_turn_if_idle()`. The strategy-pending barge-in branch also switched from `start_turn_if_idle` to the new primitive so re-anchoring happens consistently on every legitimate `speech_start`.

- **Dropped-final-transcript reset** — when `commitTranscript`/`_commit_transcript` returns False on an `is_final` / `speech_final` transcript, the same `anchor_user_speech_start()` is invoked so the discarded utterance's anchors don't leak into the next turn.

### Fixed — Cartesia STT `finalize()` exposed so VAD `speech_end` can force-flush (Python + TypeScript parity)

The 0.5.5 fast-path at `stream_handler.py:3070-3077` ("on VAD `speech_end`, call `stt.finalize()` so the provider doesn't wait for its natural-pause heuristic") was a no-op for Cartesia: `CartesiaSTT` only sent the `finalize` text frame from its private `close()` method on session shutdown, and `getattr(self._stt, "finalize", None)` returned None. The SDK's authoritative VAD silence detection (SileroVAD, 250 ms threshold) was being overridden by Cartesia's conservative internal endpointing (observed 2-7 s on PSTN audio with background hiss).

Added `async finalize()` to both `CartesiaSTT` (Python) and `CartesiaSTT` (TypeScript) that sends the canonical `finalize` text frame on the live WebSocket. The wired-but-no-op fast-path now triggers a deterministic VAD-driven STT finalisation, parity with Deepgram. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/cartesia_stt.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/providers/cartesia-stt.ts`.

### Fixed — Cerebras pricing table overcharged 1.5-2.4x across multiple models (Python + TypeScript parity)

Audited against the canonical per-model docs pages at `https://inference-docs.cerebras.ai/models/<model>`. Patter's 2026-05-08 table conflated launch-blog quotes with the current "Exploration pricing" banner shown on each model docs page. Corrections:

| Model | Old (in/out) | New (in/out) | Source |
|-------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| `gpt-oss-120b` | $0.85 / $1.20 | $0.35 / $0.75 | inference-docs.cerebras.ai/models/openai-oss |
| `llama3.1-8b` | $0.10 / $0.20 | $0.10 / $0.10 | inference-docs.cerebras.ai/models/llama-31-8b |
| `qwen-3-235b-a22b-instruct-2507` | $1.00 / $1.50 | $0.60 / $1.20 | inference-docs.cerebras.ai/models/qwen-3-235b-2507 |
| `qwen-3-coder-480b` | (missing → $0) | $2.00 / $2.00 | cerebras.ai/blog/qwen3-coder-480b |

Pre-fix a 5-turn pipeline call against the Patter-default `gpt-oss-120b` logged ~$0.000117 in `cost.llm` instead of the actual ~$0.000088 — over-reporting by a factor of ~1.3. Net: customers were never undercharged, but the dashboard line item was wrong (and 50% high for `gpt-oss-120b` specifically). Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/pricing.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/pricing.ts`. Tests updated at `libraries/python/tests/test_pricing.py`.

### Fixed — Dashboard cost rendering flattened sub-cent values to `$0.00` (`fmtCostUSD` adaptive precision)

The dashboard's per-row, per-stack, and aggregate spend tiles all used `toFixed(2)` or `toFixed(3)` for USD rendering. Cerebras `gpt-oss-120b` at $0.0001 / 5-turn-call rounds to `$0.00` under that rule, making the LLM cost line look as if billing was broken when in fact it was working end-to-end (token usage extracted from the streaming `usage` chunk, cost calculated, persisted to `metadata.json` at the correct precision).

Added `fmtCostUSD(value)` helper (`dashboard-app/src/components/format.ts`) with magnitude-adaptive precision: ≥$0.01 → 2 decimals, ≥$0.001 → 3 decimals, ≥$0.0001 → 4 decimals, smaller values → 5 decimals. Applied across all 12 cost render sites (`App.tsx` spend tile, `CallTable.tsx` row total, `Metric.tsx` headline + per-call row, `CostPanel.tsx` × 5, `MetricsPanel.tsx` × 4). A 5-turn Cerebras pipeline call now shows `$0.00012` instead of `$0.00`.

### Fixed — Dashboard latency metrics: real percentiles, correct waterfall, n<5 percentile gate

The "Latency · this call" panel was showing three different numbers labelled wrong:
1. **"p50" was the avg of total_ms**, not the median (`mappers.ts:194` read `latencyP50: latencyAvg.total_ms`).
2. **The "llm" bar in the waterfall was the same fake p50**, double-counting non-LLM time (waterfall `llm = call.latencyP50` instead of `avg(llm_ms)`). The bar was off by ~5x on real PSTN data.
3. **p50/p95 were rendered with as few as 1 turn**, where percentiles are statistical noise (linear interpolation between two samples).

Round-trip `total_ms` also includes the user-utterance duration on the speech-to-speech metric, which over-states user-perceived latency. The dashboard now exposes `agent_response_ms` (wait time after the user stops speaking) as a separate primary metric.

Fixes shipped:
- **SDK serialization** (`libraries/python/getpatter/server.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/server.ts`) — `metadata.json` now persists the full `LatencyBreakdown` per percentile (`avg`, `p50`, `p95`, `p99`) with all components (`stt_ms`, `llm_ms`, `tts_ms`, `total_ms`, `agent_response_ms`, `endpoint_ms`, `user_speech_duration_ms`). The flat `p50_ms / p95_ms / p99_ms` totals are kept for backward-compat with consumers that read only summaries.
- **Dashboard hydrate** (`libraries/python/getpatter/dashboard/store.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/dashboard/store.ts`) — `_metrics_from_top_level` reads the full breakdown when present; falls back to the synthetic single-`total_ms` shim only for legacy metadata that lacked the breakdown.
- **Dashboard UI** (`dashboard-app/src/lib/api.ts`, `mappers.ts`, `components/CallTable.tsx`, `components/LatencyPanel.tsx`, `components/MetricsPanel.tsx`) — `Call` gains `llmAvg`, `turnCount`, `agentResponseP50/P95`. `latencyP50` now reads from `latency_p50.total_ms` (true median); the waterfall `llm` bar uses `llmAvg`. Percentile boxes render `—` and a "n turns — percentiles need ≥5" hint when `turnCount < 5`. The Latency panel adds a `p50 wait / p95 wait` pair sourced from `agent_response_ms`, the user-perceived "time waited after I stopped speaking" metric.

Backward compat: legacy `metadata.json` (no `avg/p50/p95/p99` objects, only flat percentiles) still hydrates — those rows just lack the per-component breakdown in the panel and show `—` for `p50 wait / p95 wait`. No public API change.

### Changed — First-turn cold-start: keep prewarmed WebSockets OPEN and adopt them at call connect (Python + TypeScript parity)

Investigation of live PSTN-pipeline first-turn p95 latency (~3 s observed in production acceptance) showed the existing prewarm pattern (open WS, idle ~250 ms, close) saves only ~50-250 ms — DNS cache + edge-worker pinning at best. The dominant first-turn cost on PSTN pipeline is the synchronous TLS + WS-upgrade + protocol-handshake against STT (~150-400 ms) and TTS (~400-900 ms) when the call starts. Opening + closing a WS does NOT thread `session: <previousTicket>` across `new WebSocket()` calls in Node's `ws` package (and Python's `websockets` library has the same property at the TCP / TLS level), so each fresh open re-pays the full handshake.

Structural fix: the prewarm pipeline now keeps each provider WebSocket OPEN during the carrier ringing window and hands the live socket off to the per-call `StreamHandler` at `start`, skipping the cold handshake entirely on the first turn.

- **`Patter._prewarmed_connections` (Python) / `Patter.prewarmedConnections` (TS)** — new per-call_id cache holding pre-opened, fully-handshaked provider WebSockets. Populated by the new `_park_provider_connections(agent, call_id)` (Py) / `parkProviderConnections(agent, callId)` (TS), which runs in parallel with the carrier-side `initiate_call`. Each parked slot may hold up to three handles (`stt`, `tts`, `openai_realtime`); each is consumed exactly once. A 30 s safety TTL force-closes any slot whose carrier never fires `start`. Drained by `pop_prewarmed_connections(call_id)` on `start` (consumes the handles into the StreamHandler), `close_prewarmed_connections(call_id)` on call-failure paths (no-answer / busy / failed / canceled / AMD voicemail — wired through `_record_prewarm_waste`), and `disconnect()` on Patter teardown. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py` (cache + park task + helpers + helpers `_safe_close_handle`, `_close_parked_slot`), `libraries/typescript/src/client.ts` (parity, plus the new exported `ParkedProviderConnections` interface).

- **Provider-level `open_parked_connection()` and `adopt_websocket(...)`** shipped on the three streaming providers most-affected by the cold-start cost: `CartesiaSTT`, `ElevenLabsWebSocketTTS`, `OpenAIRealtimeAdapter`. `open_parked_connection` opens the WS, sends the EXACT initial config the live `connect()` / `synthesize()` path sends (BOS frame for ElevenLabs WS, `session.update` round-trip for OpenAI Realtime), then returns the OPEN socket WITHOUT arming any recv / keepalive task — the handle is parked. `adopt_websocket` takes that handle, installs the recv + keepalive plumbing, and hands the live socket back to `StreamHandler` as if `connect()` had just finished. The TTS adapter uses a single-slot adoption queue so the existing `for await (const chunk of agent.tts.synthesizeStream(...))` call site continues to work without signature changes — and the BOS-already-sent flag prevents a protocol error on adoption. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/{cartesia_stt,elevenlabs_ws_tts,openai_realtime}.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/providers/{cartesia-stt,elevenlabs-ws-tts,openai-realtime}.ts`.

- **`StreamHandler` adopt-or-connect** — the pipeline-mode initialisation path now polls `pop_prewarmed_connections(call_id)` BEFORE `stt.connect()` / TTS firstMessage. When a parked WS is still OPEN it is adopted (logged as `[CONNECT] callId=... source=adopted ms=0`); when the parked WS died between park and adopt (server timeout, network blip), the dead handle is discarded silently and the consumer falls back to a fresh `connect()` (logged as `source=fresh ms=<elapsed>`). When no parked slot exists at all (cache miss, prewarm task slower than carrier ringing, prewarm disabled), the path is byte-identical to the prior cold-start flow — backward-compatible. Realtime adapter adoption (separate `OpenAIRealtimeStreamHandler` code path) ships the API surface but is not yet wired through the realtime stream handler — pipeline mode dominates the affected use case and the realtime wiring is a follow-up. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts`.

### Fixed — Parallelise STT.connect with TTS firstMessage kickoff (Python + TypeScript parity)

Pipeline-mode initialisation previously did `await stt.connect()` then `tts.synthesizeStream(firstMessage)` serially. STT only needs to be ready to receive incoming user audio, not to send the first agent message out — running the two in parallel saves an additional 200-400 ms on the first turn (real cost of a Deepgram / Cartesia / AssemblyAI WS upgrade). The STT receive loop launcher now awaits the deferred connect task before installing the message pump, so a half-open WS never surfaces "Not connected" on the first audio frame. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts`.

### Fixed — Pre-import AEC module at `Patter.serve()` (Python + TypeScript parity)

The acoustic echo canceller (`getpatter.audio.aec.NlmsEchoCanceller`) was lazily imported on the first call when `agent.echo_cancellation=True`, costing ~150-400 ms of dynamic-import compile / link on the hot path. `Patter.serve()` now eagerly imports the module once when `echo_cancellation` is enabled, so the first call sees the cache-warm import. Pure data — no side effects on users who never enable AEC. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/client.ts`.

### Fixed — `[PREWARM]` and `[CONNECT]` timing instrumentation (Python + TypeScript parity)

INFO-level log lines added to `_park_provider_connections` and the StreamHandler adopt-or-connect path so operators can attribute first-turn latency to specific providers without strace / packet capture. Format: `[PREWARM] callId=<id> provider=stt ms=<elapsed_to_park>`, `[CONNECT] callId=<id> provider=stt source=adopted|fresh ms=<connect_time>`. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py` + `stream_handler.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/client.ts` + `stream-handler.ts`.

Tests: `libraries/python/tests/test_prewarm_handoff.py` (6 unit tests — park task invokes `open_parked_connection` on STT + TTS, parked WS stays OPEN past 250 ms, `pop_prewarmed_connections` consumes once, `close_prewarmed_connections` and `_record_prewarm_waste` drain parked sockets, no-op when neither provider supports parking) and `libraries/typescript/tests/unit/prewarm-handoff.test.ts` (6 parity tests). Both suites use authentic real code paths — only the WS handle is stubbed (it has no business in a unit test) — per `.claude/rules/authentic-tests.md`. Defaults preserved: `agent.prewarm` is still `true` by default, all existing tests pass without modification, and providers that do not implement `open_parked_connection` (everything except the three above) fall through to the prior `warmup()`-then-cold-`connect()` flow.

### Fixed — Prewarm-firstMessage cache safety (5 issues, Python + TypeScript parity)

The `Agent.prewarm_first_message` opt-in shipped earlier in 0.6.1 had five edge cases where the TTS bill was paid but the cached bytes either leaked, never reached the wire, or silently wasted spend. Each fix is per FIX number from the parity audit. Defaults preserved across the board: cap = 200 concurrent prewarmed calls, TTL = `ring_timeout + 5 s`. Tests added in `libraries/python/tests/test_prewarm.py` (14 new tests) and `libraries/typescript/tests/unit/prewarm.test.ts` + `libraries/typescript/tests/unit/server-routes.test.ts` (12 new tests).

- **FIX #91 — cache eviction on abnormal hangup.** `_record_prewarm_waste` was only called from `Patter.end_call(call_sid)`. When a call went to `no-answer` / `busy` / `failed` / `canceled` (Twilio) or hit `call.hangup` / AMD voicemail (Telnyx), the `_prewarm_audio[call_id]` entry leaked until the user explicitly invoked `end_call`. Twilio status callback handler now invokes `record_prewarm_waste` for the four abnormal `CallStatus` values and on the AMD `machine_end_*` paths; Telnyx webhook handler now does the same on `call.hangup` (any `hangup_cause`) and on `call.machine.detection.ended` with `result == "machine"`. `_record_prewarm_waste` is now idempotent — the `_prewarm_consumed` set is checked first, so the status callback firing before `end_call` (or vice-versa) does not double-WARN. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/server.py` (status / AMD / call.hangup branches), `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py` (`_record_prewarm_waste` idempotency guard, `_prewarm_consumed` set, server forwarding), `libraries/typescript/src/server.ts` (parity), `libraries/typescript/src/client.ts` (parity).

- **FIX #92 — race start-vs-prewarm-task → orphan bytes.** When the carrier's `start` event arrived BEFORE the prewarm TTS task completed, `pop_prewarm_audio` returned `None`, the `StreamHandler` correctly fell back to live TTS, BUT the prewarm task continued in the background and eventually wrote bytes to `_prewarm_audio[call_id]` — orphaning them in the cache until `end_call` ran. Combined with FIX #91, every fast-pickup call leaked the prewarm bytes. **Option A (race-guard)** chosen for the minimum-fix bound. New `_prewarm_consumed: set[str]` tracks every `pop_prewarm_audio` call (hit OR miss). The prewarm task checks membership before writing bytes; on race-finish, the bytes are dropped and a WARN names the `call_id` plus byte count so the wasted spend is observable. Option B (200 ms wait window for the synth to land) was rejected as adding more latency-coupled state for marginal recovery. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py` (`_spawn_prewarm_first_message._run`), `libraries/typescript/src/client.ts` (parity).

- **FIX #93 — `disconnect()` did not clean up prewarm.** Across `serve()` → `disconnect()` → `serve()` cycles within the same `Patter` instance, in-flight `_prewarm_tasks` continued to run (the TTS WebSocket stayed open and billed) and stale `_prewarm_audio` entries leaked. `disconnect()` now cancels every task in `_prewarm_tasks`, `await`s the cancellation via `asyncio.gather(..., return_exceptions=True)` (Py) / `Promise.allSettled` with a 1 s safety timeout (TS), cancels any pending TTL eviction tasks, and clears `_prewarm_audio` + `_prewarm_consumed`. The instance is fully reusable: a follow-up `serve()` sees a clean cache. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py` (`Patter.disconnect`), `libraries/typescript/src/client.ts` (parity).

- **FIX #94 — Realtime/ConvAI silently waste TTS spend.** `agent.prewarm_first_message=True` paired with `agent.provider="openai_realtime"` or `"elevenlabs_convai"` paid the TTS bill on every outbound call but never streamed the cached bytes — the `StreamHandler` for those modes runs the firstMessage emit through the provider's own audio path, never consulting `pop_prewarm_audio`. `Patter.call` now checks the provider mode at `_spawn_prewarm_first_message` entry; when `provider != "pipeline"` it logs a WARN and refuses to spawn the synth task. Both SDK docstrings (`Agent.prewarm_first_message`, `AgentOptions.prewarmFirstMessage`) updated to document the constraint. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py`, `libraries/python/getpatter/models.py` (docstring), `libraries/typescript/src/client.ts`, `libraries/typescript/src/types.ts` (JSDoc).

- **FIX #96 — prewarm cache unbounded (memory DoS).** A flood of `Patter.call(...)` invocations (legitimate or attacker-controlled) could pile up tens of MB of orphan TTS bytes that never evicted when the carrier never fired `start`. Two bounds added: (a) **size cap** at `_PREWARM_CACHE_MAX = 200` (Py) / `PREWARM_CACHE_MAX = 200` (TS) concurrent entries (live cache + in-flight synth tasks). When the cap is reached, new prewarm spawns are refused with a WARN and the call still proceeds — only the optimisation is skipped. (b) **TTL eviction**: a per-entry timer scheduled `ring_timeout + _PREWARM_TTL_GRACE_S` (default 5 s) after the synth task completes. If the cache entry is still present when the timer fires, it is dropped and a WARN names the byte count. The timer is cancelled on normal consumption (`pop_prewarm_audio`) and on `_record_prewarm_waste`, so spurious WARNs never fire after a clean drain. Both `_PREWARM_CACHE_MAX` and `_PREWARM_TTL_GRACE_S` (Py) / `PREWARM_CACHE_MAX` and `PREWARM_TTL_GRACE_MS` (TS) are exported as module-level constants for tests and operator visibility. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py` (cap check + TTL eviction in `_spawn_prewarm_first_message`, `_evict_prewarm_after`), `libraries/typescript/src/client.ts` (parity).

### Changed — Concrete STT/TTS WebSocket prewarm overrides + OpenAI Realtime native warmup (Python + TypeScript parity)

The first prewarm pass (above) shipped LLM HTTPS-GET warmup but left STT and TTS providers on the no-op default. A second look at the cold-start latency budget revealed a priority inversion: an HTTPS GET against an LLM `/models` endpoint warms only DNS + TLS + connection pool — it does NOT prime the inference path itself, while a streaming-STT or streaming-TTS WebSocket pre-handshake (full TLS + auth + initial config exchange) saves 200-500 ms per call on cold start. OpenAI's Realtime API exposes a native warmup primitive (`response.create` with `generate: false`) that prepares request state without billing tokens. This entry rebalances the prewarm pipeline to put the wins where they actually live.

- **STT WebSocket prewarms** — concrete `warmup()` overrides shipped on `DeepgramSTT`, `CartesiaSTT`, and `AssemblyAISTT`. Each opens the streaming WebSocket (full DNS + TLS + auth handshake), idles ~250 ms so the provider edge keeps the session warm in its routing table, then closes cleanly. By the time `connect()` is invoked at call-pickup the resolver and TLS session are hot — net wire time saving of 200-500 ms vs a cold WS open. **Billing safety**: all three providers bill on streamed audio seconds (Deepgram per [pricing](https://deepgram.com/pricing); Cartesia per [STT API reference](https://docs.cartesia.ai/2025-04-16/api-reference/stt/stt); AssemblyAI per [pricing](https://www.assemblyai.com/pricing)). Opening + closing the WebSocket without sending any audio frames does not consume billable seconds. The override docstrings reference the per-provider billing model so future contributors don't accidentally regress this. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/{deepgram_stt,cartesia_stt,assemblyai_stt}.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/providers/{deepgram-stt,cartesia-stt,assemblyai-stt}.ts`.

- **TTS prewarms — WebSocket and HTTP** — concrete `warmup()` overrides shipped on `ElevenLabsWebSocketTTS` (WS), `CartesiaTTS` (HTTP `/tts/bytes`), and `InworldTTS` (HTTP `/tts/v1/voice:stream`). The ElevenLabs WS variant opens the stream-input WebSocket, sends the protocol-required single-space keepalive `{"text": " "}` so the server creates and warms the session, idles ~250 ms, then closes. The HTTP-only providers (Cartesia, Inworld) issue a lightweight `GET /voices` (Cartesia) or `HEAD` against the streaming base host (Inworld) to warm DNS + TLS + HTTP/2 — smaller win (~50-150 ms) than the WS variant (~200-500 ms) but still real on cold-start calls. **Billing safety**: ElevenLabs bills on synthesised characters delivered via `audio` frames (per [pricing](https://elevenlabs.io/pricing)) — the keepalive primer is the documented session-establishment frame and does NOT commit synthesis (no `flush: true`, no real text). Cartesia `GET /voices` is a free metadata read; Inworld `HEAD` does not invoke the synthesis pipeline. Tests in both SDKs explicitly assert no `flush: true`, no audio frames, and no synthesis POST during warmup. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/{elevenlabs_ws_tts,cartesia_tts,inworld_tts}.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/providers/{elevenlabs-ws-tts,cartesia-tts,inworld-tts}.ts`.

- **OpenAI Realtime native warmup (`response.create` with `generate: false`)** — concrete `warmup()` override shipped on `OpenAIRealtimeAdapter`. Per OpenAI's documented [websocket-mode warmup pattern](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/websocket-mode), the canonical warm step on the Realtime API is to open a session and send `response.create` with `response.generate=false` — this prepares the model's request state and primes inference far more effectively than a generic HTTPS GET. Implementation: open the WS, wait for `session.created`, send `{"type": "response.create", "response": {"generate": false}}`, capture the `response.id` from the resulting `response.created` event into `self._prewarm_response_id` (Py) / `this.prewarmResponseId` (TS), then close. The id is stored so a future call can chain it as `previous_response_id` when the chaining path is wired through `connect()`; for now we capture-and-discard, taking half the win (priming the global session state) without the cross-session-state plumbing complexity. **Billing safety**: `response.create` with `generate: false` is documented as a no-token warmup variant that does not invoke the model — no per-token cost is accrued. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/openai_realtime.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/providers/openai-realtime.ts`.

- **LLM HTTP-GET warmup retained but documented as low-impact** — the existing `OpenAILLMProvider.warmup` (and its Anthropic / Google / Cerebras / Groq subclasses) still issues a 5 s-bounded `GET <base_url>/models` to warm DNS + TLS + connection pool, saving ~150-400 ms on cold start. The docstring on the base implementation now explicitly calls out that an HTTPS GET does NOT warm the inference path itself — for true inference warmup a real low-token request is needed, left as a follow-up. STT / TTS WebSocket prewarms (above) dominate the cold-start latency budget. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/services/llm_loop.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/llm-loop.ts`.

Tests: `libraries/python/tests/unit/test_provider_warmup.py` (14 unit tests — Deepgram / Cartesia / AssemblyAI / ElevenLabs WS / Cartesia TTS / Inworld / OpenAI Realtime each verified for: warmup completes, WS opened + closed, no audio / no synthesis-commit frames sent during warmup, errors swallowed at DEBUG) and `libraries/typescript/tests/unit/provider-warmup.mocked.test.ts` (15 parity tests). Tests are tagged `@pytest.mark.mocked` (Py) / filename `*.mocked.test.ts` (TS) per `.claude/rules/authentic-tests.md` — only the network boundary is mocked; protocol negotiation, URL construction, and the warmup logic itself run real code. Defaults preserved: `agent.prewarm` is still `true` by default, warmup remains a no-op for unmodified custom providers, and existing tests pass without modification.

### Added — Pre-warm and pre-synth firstMessage (Python + TypeScript parity)

Cold-start latency on the first turn of an outbound call is dominated by DNS / TLS / HTTP-keepalive handshakes against the LLM and TTS providers (typical: 200-700 ms TTS first-byte plus 150-400 ms LLM connection setup, on top of the carrier's 3-15 s ringing window). The `Agent.prewarm` and `Agent.prewarm_first_message` flags let `Patter.call(...)` reclaim that lost latency by working in parallel with the carrier-side `initiate_call`.

- **`Agent.prewarm: bool = True`** (Python) / **`agent.prewarm?: boolean`** (TypeScript, default `true` when undefined). When `True`, `Patter.call` spawns a fire-and-forget task that invokes the optional `warmup()` method on the configured STT, TTS, and LLM providers in parallel via `asyncio.gather(..., return_exceptions=True)` (Python) / `Promise.allSettled` (TS). Built-in LLM providers ship a real warmup that issues a 5 s-bounded HTTPS `GET /models` to the upstream — OpenAI (`https://api.openai.com/v1/models`), Anthropic (`https://api.anthropic.com/v1/models`), Google (`https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models`), Cerebras (`https://api.cerebras.ai/v1/models`), Groq (`https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/models`). STT and TTS providers inherit a no-op default; concrete providers can override `async warmup() -> None` (Python ABC) / `warmup?(): Promise<void>` (TS interface) to prime their own connections. Failures are logged at DEBUG and never abort the call — the feature is pure latency optimisation. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/base.py` (default `warmup` on `STTProvider`, `TTSProvider`), `libraries/python/getpatter/services/llm_loop.py` (`OpenAILLMProvider.warmup`), `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/anthropic_llm.py`, `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/google_llm.py`, `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py` (`Patter._spawn_provider_warmup`), `libraries/typescript/src/llm-loop.ts` (`LLMProvider.warmup` optional + `OpenAILLMProvider.warmup`), `libraries/typescript/src/providers/cerebras-llm.ts`, `libraries/typescript/src/providers/groq-llm.ts`, `libraries/typescript/src/providers/anthropic-llm.ts`, `libraries/typescript/src/providers/google-llm.ts`, `libraries/typescript/src/provider-factory.ts` (`STTAdapter.warmup`, `TTSAdapter.warmup` optional), `libraries/typescript/src/client.ts` (`Patter.spawnProviderWarmup`).

- **`Agent.prewarm_first_message: bool = False`** (Python) / **`agent.prewarmFirstMessage?: boolean = false`** (TypeScript). Off by default to preserve the prior cost surface. When `True`, after `Patter.call` resolves the carrier-issued `call_id` it spawns a background task that calls `agent.tts.synthesize(agent.first_message)` (Python) / `agent.tts.synthesizeStream(agent.firstMessage)` (TS), accumulates the bytes, and stores the buffer in `Patter._prewarm_audio[call_id]` / `Patter.prewarmAudio.set(callId, buffer)`. The synth is bounded by `ring_timeout` (default 25 s) so a never-answered call can't tie up the TTS connection. The per-call `StreamHandler` (`PipelineStreamHandler` Python / `StreamHandler.runPipeline` TS) now checks the cache via `pop_prewarm_audio(call_id)` / `popPrewarmAudio(callId)` at the start of the firstMessage emit; on a cache hit the buffer is sent directly through the carrier-side audio sender (which handles native-rate → carrier-rate resampling identically to the live TTS path), the `tts.synthesize` round-trip is skipped, and TTS first-byte latency drops to ~0 ms. **Cost implication**: the TTS bill for `agent.first_message` is paid as soon as the synth task completes, even when the call is never answered (no-answer / busy / AMD voicemail). When the call ends without consuming the cache, `Patter.end_call` / `Patter.endCall` log a WARN naming the wasted call_id and approximate byte count so operators see the cost surface explicitly. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py` (`Patter._prewarm_audio`, `pop_prewarm_audio`, `_record_prewarm_waste`, `_spawn_prewarm_first_message`), `libraries/python/getpatter/server.py` (`EmbeddedServer.pop_prewarm_audio` forward), `libraries/python/getpatter/telephony/twilio.py` + `telnyx.py` (bridge accepts `pop_prewarm_audio`), `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py` (`PipelineStreamHandler` consumes cache in firstMessage emit), `libraries/typescript/src/client.ts` (`Patter.prewarmAudio`, `popPrewarmAudio`, `recordPrewarmWaste`, `spawnPrewarmFirstMessage`), `libraries/typescript/src/server.ts` (`EmbeddedServer.popPrewarmAudio`), `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts` (`StreamHandlerDeps.popPrewarmAudio`, firstMessage emit consumes cache).

Tests: `libraries/python/tests/test_prewarm.py` (14 unit tests covering default flag values, no-op default `warmup`, all-three-providers warmup invocation, opt-out via `prewarm=False`, exception swallow at DEBUG, cache populate / skip / empty-message / timeout, one-shot pop semantics, waste-warn log, StreamHandler cache-hit short-circuit + cache-miss live-TTS fallback) and `libraries/typescript/tests/unit/prewarm.test.ts` (11 parity tests). Both suites use authentic real code paths — only the network boundary is exercised through stubs — per `.claude/rules/authentic-tests.md`. Defaults preserved: `agent.prewarm` is `true` and warmup is a no-op for unmodified providers, so existing tests pass without modification; `agent.prewarm_first_message` is `false`, so the new TTS-bill cost surface is strictly opt-in.

### Changed — Dashboard: STT and TTS rendered as separate cost rows

The cost breakdown panel previously combined STT and TTS spend into a single "STT / TTS" line, which hid which side of the audio pipeline dominated cost. The two providers are typically distinct (e.g. Cartesia STT + ElevenLabs TTS) and bill at very different rates per second of audio. The panel now renders them as two adjacent rows labeled with the actual provider name (e.g. "Cartesia STT" / "ElevenLabs TTS"), driven by `record.metrics.stt_provider` / `tts_provider` already exposed by the backend. The legacy `CallCostUi.sttTts` field is kept in `dashboard-app/src/lib/mappers.ts` for the few aggregate-spend callers (`callSpend`, totals bar) and is now derived as `stt + tts` after both granular fields are populated. Files: `dashboard-app/src/lib/mappers.ts`, `dashboard-app/src/components/CostPanel.tsx`.

### Changed — `stt_ms` is now finalization-only (Python + TypeScript parity)

⚠️ Semantic change to `LatencyBreakdown.stt_ms`. Previously the value measured `stt_complete - turn_start`, which conflated user speech duration with STT processing — a 5 s utterance produced `stt_ms ≈ 5000` even when Cartesia / Deepgram finalized in 200 ms after end-of-speech. The legacy interpretation was misleading: industry benchmarks (Picovoice, Deepgram, Gladia, Speechmatics, Daily.co) all report STT latency as the **finalization window** — `final_transcript - end_of_speech` — independent of how long the user spoke. `stt_ms` now matches that definition: it measures from the endpoint signal (VAD `speech_stop` or STT `speech_final`, whichever comes first) to the final transcript delivery. When the endpoint signal is unavailable (degraded provider, batch STT) the metric falls back to the legacy `turn_start` anchor so dashboards never see a spuriously zero value.

A new optional field `LatencyBreakdown.user_speech_duration_ms` (`userSpeechDurationMs` over the wire stays `user_speech_duration_ms` for SDK parity) carries the displaced "how long did the user speak" number, populated only when the endpoint signal is present. Together with the existing `agent_response_ms` (silence detection + LLM TTFT + TTS first-byte) and `total_ms` (turn_start → first agent audio byte), the breakdown now cleanly separates the four orthogonal slices a voice-AI dashboard needs: utterance length, STT finalization, LLM TTFT, TTS first-byte. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/models.py`, `libraries/python/getpatter/services/metrics.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/metrics.ts`.

### Added — OTel `patter.*` span attributes (Python only; TS parity follow-up)

⚠️ Parity gap: this lands in the Python SDK only. TypeScript follow-up is tracked separately and will land in a subsequent release. Per `.claude/rules/sdk-parity.md` every public feature must reach both SDKs; this is a known time-boxed exception.

- **`getpatter.observability.attributes`** — three new helpers added: `record_patter_attrs(attrs)`, `patter_call_scope(call_id, side)` (context manager), and `attach_span_exporter(patter, exporter, side)`. Lazy-OTel-guarded; no-op when the `[tracing]` extra is not installed. Two ContextVars (`patter.call_id`, `patter.side`) propagate through the asyncio task tree so spans emitted by deeply nested provider code inherit the active call's identity automatically. File: `libraries/python/getpatter/observability/attributes.py`. The three symbols are re-exported from `getpatter.observability` for direct import.
- **`Patter._attach_span_exporter(exporter, *, side="uut")`** — public-but-underscore hook for tools that observe Patter from outside (e.g. an out-of-process agent runner). Default `side="uut"` preserves all existing behaviour. The leading underscore signals it is not part of the customer-facing API surface. File: `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py`.
- **Per-provider cost emission (19 surfaces)** — `patter.cost.{telephony_minutes, stt_seconds, tts_chars, llm_input_tokens, llm_output_tokens, realtime_minutes}` are now stamped on the active span across the provider lineup (Twilio + Telnyx telephony adapters; Deepgram, AssemblyAI, Whisper, OpenAI Transcribe, Soniox, Speechmatics, Cartesia STT; ElevenLabs, OpenAI, Cartesia, LMNT, Rime TTS; OpenAI/Anthropic/Google/Groq/Cerebras LLM; OpenAI Realtime + ElevenLabs ConvAI realtime). Provider tag emitted alongside as `patter.{telephony,stt,tts,llm,realtime}.provider`. All call sites are wrapped in defensive `try/except` so observability cannot kill a live call.
- **Per-turn latency** — `patter.latency.{ttfb_ms, turn_ms}` stamped from `StreamHandler._emit_turn_metrics` via a new `PipelineHookExecutor.record_turn_latency(*, ttfb_ms, turn_ms)` method. `ttfb_ms` maps to `total_ms` (turn-start → first TTS audio byte, the user-perceptible TTFB); `turn_ms` maps to `tts_total_ms` and falls back to `total_ms` when null. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/services/pipeline_hooks.py`, `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`.
- **`patter_call_scope` enters at the bridge level** so the entire WebSocket bridge lifetime — including hangup / cleanup — is bound to `patter.call_id` and `patter.side`. The scope is opened on the Twilio `start` / Telnyx `streaming.started` event (when the call_id is known) and closed in the `finally:` block via `contextlib.ExitStack`, so cleanup-emitted spans (handler.cleanup, telephony cost queries, on_call_end) inherit the call identity. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/telephony/twilio.py`, `libraries/python/getpatter/telephony/telnyx.py`.
- **`TwilioAdapter.record_call_end_cost` / `TelnyxAdapter.record_call_end_cost`** — adapter-level helpers used by the bridge to emit `patter.cost.telephony_minutes` once the call's wall-clock duration is known. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/twilio_adapter.py`, `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/telnyx_adapter.py`.
- **Docs**: `docs/python-sdk/tracing.mdx` updated with a new "Cost and latency attributes (`patter.*`)" section and an "Attach a custom exporter" example showing how to wire `Patter._attach_span_exporter` to an `InMemorySpanExporter` for tests or to an `OTLPSpanExporter` in production.

### Added — Opt-in barge-in confirmation strategies (Python + TypeScript)

- **Opt-in barge-in confirmation strategies** (Python + TypeScript parity, fully backward-compatible). Cloud TTS providers take 200-700 ms to emit the first audio byte and PSTN background noise routinely fires VAD before any real interruption is happening; the legacy "any VAD speech_start during TTS cancels the agent" contract therefore produced frequent false-positive cancels — the agent was cut by cough/click/HVAC/breath and lost the conversational thread. The new ``Agent.barge_in_strategies`` (Python) / ``agent.bargeInStrategies`` (TypeScript) tuple lets callers opt into a two-stage confirmation pipeline: VAD speech_start during TTS now marks the barge-in as *pending* (TTS keeps streaming naturally, the in-flight LLM stream is preserved), every STT transcript is fed to each configured strategy, and the first strategy that returns ``True`` cancels the agent and runs the existing flush sequence; if no strategy confirms within ``barge_in_confirm_ms`` (default 1500 ms) the pending state is dropped and the agent finishes its sentence. New module ``getpatter.services.barge_in_strategies`` exposes the ``BargeInStrategy`` Protocol, the ``MinWordsStrategy`` reference implementation (filters short backchannels — "okay", "uh-huh", "yeah" — by requiring N words while the agent is speaking and letting any single word through while the agent is silent), and ``evaluate_strategies`` / ``reset_strategies`` helpers with short-circuit-OR composition and per-strategy error isolation. TS twin in ``src/services/barge-in-strategies.ts``. Wiring lives in ``stream_handler.py`` ``_handle_barge_in`` / ``stream-handler.ts`` ``handleBargeIn`` — both keep the existing canBargeIn gate and only add the confirm step when at least one strategy is configured. Defaults preserved: ``barge_in_strategies=()`` matches the prior cancel-immediately behaviour byte-for-byte, so existing users see no change unless they opt in. New regressions: 14 unit tests for ``MinWordsStrategy`` + composition (Py); 15 parity tests (TS); 10 end-to-end tests covering pending lifecycle, confirmation, timeout, idempotency, and threshold parametrization (Py); 10 TS twins. Files: ``libraries/python/getpatter/services/barge_in_strategies.py``, ``libraries/python/getpatter/models.py``, ``libraries/python/getpatter/__init__.py``, ``libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py``, ``libraries/typescript/src/services/barge-in-strategies.ts``, ``libraries/typescript/src/types.ts``, ``libraries/typescript/src/index.ts``, ``libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts``.

### Fixed

- **Dashboard live-transcript: live pane now accumulates user/assistant lines across every turn** (TypeScript-only, frontend + backend, dashboard BUG 1). The live-transcript fallback in `dashboard-app/src/lib/mappers.ts` derived UI rows from `record.turns[]` (the `TurnMetrics` shape), but the primary mapper path checked `record.transcript.length > 0` — which was always empty for in-flight calls because the active record only carried `turns[]`. On every `turn_complete` SSE the pane re-rendered from a single source of truth that flickered between "fallback derived from one turn" and "primary path with empty transcript", producing the symptom that the most recent user/agent pair would replace the previously-rendered turn instead of appending. Fix: `MetricsStore.recordTurn` now mirrors each completed round-trip into a flat `transcript` array on the active record (one `{role:'user', text, timestamp}` entry when `user_text` is non-empty, one `{role:'assistant', text, timestamp}` entry when `agent_text` is non-empty and not the `[interrupted]` sentinel). The mapper's primary path therefore sees an accumulating `user → assistant → user → assistant → …` history live, identical in shape to what completed calls expose. Files: `libraries/typescript/src/dashboard/store.ts`. New regressions: `libraries/typescript/tests/dashboard-store.test.ts` — `recordTurn appends both user and assistant lines to active.transcript across turns` (3-turn round-trip; asserts 5 entries in the right order) and `recordTurn skips '[interrupted]' agent_text and empty user_text from active.transcript` (filters first-message/interrupted edge cases).

- **Dashboard live-transcript: pane no longer goes blank in the carrier-statusCallback → recordCallEnd race window** (TypeScript-only, frontend + backend, dashboard BUG 2). The Twilio `statusCallback` for `CallStatus=completed` runs `MetricsStore.updateCallStatus(callId, 'completed', …)`, which moved the active record into the completed buffer WITHOUT preserving its running `turns[]` / `transcript[]`. The subsequent WS-driven `recordCallEnd` then overwrote the row in place — but in the race window between those two events the completed entry had no transcript, and any `useTranscript` fetch in that window cleared the live-pane render. Three coupled fixes: (1) `updateCallStatus` now copies `active.turns` and `active.transcript` into the new completed entry on the terminal-status branch; (2) `recordCallEnd` falls back to the running active/existing transcript when `data.transcript` is empty (e.g. `endCall` invoked without an authoritative history payload); (3) the `useTranscript` hook in `dashboard-app/src/hooks/useTranscript.ts` now subscribes to SSE `call_end` events (in addition to `turn_complete`) and refetches the call detail the moment `recordCallEnd` lands the SDK-authoritative `history.entries` transcript. Files: `libraries/typescript/src/dashboard/store.ts`, `dashboard-app/src/hooks/useTranscript.ts`. New regressions: `libraries/typescript/tests/dashboard-store.test.ts` — three new cases covering `updateCallStatus('completed')` carry-over, `recordCallEnd` running-transcript fallback when `data.transcript` is missing, and the explicit `data.transcript` taking precedence over the running fallback.

- **Dashboard sparkline tooltip: per-card metric-specific aggregate (count / avg latency / total cost)** (TypeScript-only, frontend, dashboard BUG 4). Every metric card's hover tooltip showed the same generic "N call(s)" headline and a per-call sample list — so the spend card and the latency card were indistinguishable from the calls card. The tooltip now reports a metric-specific aggregate above the per-call sample list: `TOTAL COST $X.XXX` (sum of per-call cost in the bucket) for the spend card, `AVG LATENCY <p95-mean> ms` (mean of per-call P95 in the bucket) for the latency card, and `N CALLS` for the count cards (existing behaviour, made explicit). Headline label uppercased, monospace, and styled to match the existing time-range header so the tooltip reads consistently with the rest of the site. New `MetricKind` type (`'count' | 'latency' | 'spend'`) drives the headline calculation in pure form via the new `bucketHeadline` export, callable from tests. Files: `dashboard-app/src/components/Metric.tsx`, `dashboard-app/src/App.tsx`, `dashboard-app/src/styles/dashboard.css`.

- **Dashboard: outbound call disappeared from the recent-calls table after end** (Python + TypeScript parity, BUG C, behavioural fix). The Twilio `statusCallback` for `CallStatus=completed` arrives a moment before the WS `stop` frame and runs `update_call_status` / `updateCallStatus`, which already moves the row from `_active_calls` / `activeCalls` into the completed list. Shortly after, the WS-stop path runs `record_call_end` / `recordCallEnd` for the same call_id — but the active record is already gone, so the prior implementations appended a SECOND row with `started_at=0`, empty caller/callee, and freshly captured metrics. `MetricsStore.get_calls` returns newest-first and the dashboard SPA's `mergeCalls` keeps only the first match by call_id, so the older well-formed row was masked by the malformed duplicate; the duplicate's `startedAtMs=0` then dropped it out of the 24h time-range filter and the call vanished from the UI altogether. `record_call_end` / `recordCallEnd` now look up the existing entry in `_calls` / `calls[]` and update it in place (preserving caller/callee/started_at, merging in the just-collected metrics) instead of appending a duplicate. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/dashboard/store.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/dashboard/store.ts`. New regressions: `libraries/python/tests/unit/test_dashboard_store_unit.py::TestRecordCallEndDeduplication` (2 tests — exercises the full `record_call_initiated → record_call_start → update_call_status → record_call_end` sequence and asserts (a) `call_count == 1` (no duplicate), (b) caller/callee/started_at preserved, (c) the call survives the 24h time-range filter); equivalent 2-test describe in `libraries/typescript/tests/dashboard-store.test.ts`.

- **Dashboard: live transcript pane stayed empty during in-flight calls** (Python + TypeScript parity, BUG A, frontend + backend). Two coupled bugs hid streaming transcripts from the dashboard SPA while a call was in progress: (1) `GET /api/dashboard/calls/:callId` only consulted the completed-call buffer (`store.get_call` / `store.getCall`), returning 404 for any active call; the SPA's `useTranscript` hook polled this route every 2 s and rendered `[]` for the entire call lifetime. (2) The completed-call shape exposes `transcript: TranscriptEntry[]` while active records expose `turns: TurnMetrics[]` (the per-round-trip metrics shape), and `toUiTranscript` in `dashboard-app/src/lib/mappers.ts` only knew how to read `transcript`. Both routes (`/api/dashboard/calls/:callId` and the v1 `/api/v1/calls/:callId`) now fall through to `get_active` / `getActive` when the completed lookup misses, so the live record is reachable. `toUiTranscript` now falls back to `record.turns` when `record.transcript` is empty, deriving user/agent message rows from `user_text` / `agent_text` (skipping the sentinel `[interrupted]` turns). `useTranscript` additionally subscribes to `/api/dashboard/events` for `turn_complete` events filtered by `call_id` so new turns appear within ~50 ms of the round-trip ending — the existing 2 s polling stays in place as a backstop for SSE drops. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/dashboard/routes.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/dashboard/routes.ts`, `dashboard-app/src/lib/mappers.ts`, `dashboard-app/src/hooks/useTranscript.ts`. New regression: `libraries/python/tests/unit/test_dashboard_store_unit.py::TestActiveCallDetail::test_get_active_returns_record_with_turns` (verifies the accessor the route now falls back to exposes the live turns).

- **Dashboard logs: outbound calls persisted with empty `caller` / `callee` in `metadata.json`** (Python + TypeScript parity, BUG B). Inline TwiML for outbound calls (`<Connect><Stream url="…/ws/stream/outbound"/></Connect>`) carries no `<Parameter>` tags and no query-string metadata, so the WS bridge's `caller` / `callee` are empty strings on outbound. The `_on_call_start` (Py) / `wrapLoggingCallbacks` (TS) wrappers passed those empty strings straight to `CallLogger.log_call_start` / `logCallStart`, and every outbound call's persisted `metadata.json` ended up with `caller=""` / `callee=""` even though the in-memory store had the correct numbers (populated at dial time by `record_call_initiated`). Wrappers now resolve caller/callee from the active store record when the bridge data is empty, so `metadata.json` is faithful to the dial. As a related parity fix: `record_call_start` (Py) was also clobbering existing caller/callee with the empty strings on the upgrade-from-initiated path; it now mirrors the existing TS behaviour and only overwrites when the new value is non-empty. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/server.py`, `libraries/python/getpatter/dashboard/store.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/server.ts`. New regressions: `libraries/python/tests/unit/test_server_unit.py::TestWrapCallbacks::test_call_log_start_pulls_caller_from_active_record` (real `CallLogger` writes a real `metadata.json`; asserts the masked phone numbers end with the original last-4) and `libraries/typescript/tests/server.test.ts` (parity test in `EmbeddedServer wraps logging callbacks with active-record fallback`).

- **Barge-in: `InterruptionMetrics.detection_delay_ms` corrupted to ~0 on strategy-confirmed cancel** (Python + TypeScript parity, FIX #88, fully backward-compatible). When `agent.barge_in_strategies` was non-empty, the two-stage barge-in flow stamped T1 via `record_overlap_start()` from `_start_pending_barge_in` (VAD speech_start) and then stamped T2 via a SECOND `record_overlap_start()` from `_do_cancel_for_barge_in` after the strategy confirmed — overwriting T1. The downstream `record_overlap_end()` therefore computed `T2 → now ≈ 0`, hiding the real ~150-500 ms VAD-to-confirm latency on every confirmed barge-in. The cancel path now captures the pending state BEFORE clearing it and skips the redundant `record_overlap_start()` when VAD already started the overlap window. Legacy path (`barge_in_strategies=()`, no VAD pending phase) is unchanged — `_do_cancel_for_barge_in` is still the sole caller of `record_overlap_start` there. New regressions in `libraries/python/tests/unit/test_barge_in_two_stage.py::TestBargeInOverlapStartPreserved` (3 tests including end-to-end via real `CallMetricsAccumulator` asserting detection_delay reflects the ~200 ms VAD→confirm window, not ~0) and `libraries/typescript/tests/unit/barge-in-two-stage.test.ts` (`StreamHandler — overlap window preserved across VAD → strategy confirm`, 2 tests). Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts`.

- **Barge-in: leaked pending-confirmation task on call end** (Python + TypeScript parity, FIX #89, fully backward-compatible). `PipelineStreamHandler.cleanup` (Py) and `StreamHandler.handleStop` / `handleWsClose` (TS) tore down STT / TTS / remote adapters but never dropped the pending barge-in timeout. If a call ended while a barge-in was in pending-timeout state (waiting for strategy confirmation), the asyncio.Task / `setTimeout` remained scheduled and fired `record_overlap_end` / `recordOverlapEnd` on a finalised metrics object `barge_in_confirm_ms` later (default 1500 ms) — a slow leak in long-running servers and a race producing spurious overlap_end events on unrelated subsequent calls if the metrics object got GC'd and reused. Both SDKs now call `_clear_pending_barge_in` / `clearPendingBargeIn` at the top of cleanup, before any other tear-down. Idempotent: safe to call when no pending state exists, so the legacy non-strategy flow is unchanged byte-for-byte. New regressions in `libraries/python/tests/unit/test_barge_in_two_stage.py::TestCleanupClearsPendingBargeIn` (2 tests) and `libraries/typescript/tests/unit/barge-in-two-stage.test.ts` (`StreamHandler — handleStop / handleWsClose drops pending barge-in timer`, 2 tests). Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts`.

- **Docs drift: `Agent.barge_in_strategies` docstring claimed "TTS is paused"** (Python + TypeScript parity, FIX #90). The docstring on `Agent.barge_in_strategies` (Python) / `agent.bargeInStrategies` (TypeScript) said "the agent's TTS is paused" while a barge-in was pending strategy confirmation, but the implementation does the opposite: TTS continues streaming naturally and only the strategy-confirmed cancel path stops TTS. Replaced with "the agent's TTS continues streaming naturally" so users opting into the confirm pipeline aren't surprised by uninterrupted audio during the pending window. Surgical text-only fix — no behaviour change. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/models.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/types.ts`.

- **Pipeline first-message prewarm: cached audio sent as a single multi-second buffer (cancel granularity lost)** (Python + TypeScript parity, FIX #97). On a prewarm cache hit, `PipelineStreamHandler.start` (Py) and `StreamHandler.initPipeline` (TS) called `audio_sender.send_audio(prewarm_bytes)` / `bridge.sendAudio(...)` with the full multi-second buffer in one shot, while the live TTS path streams 20-128 ms chunks paced by the upstream provider. A `send_clear` issued mid-buffer therefore had nothing to clear from Twilio's mark/clear bookkeeping, manifesting as "the agent keeps talking after barge-in" on the very first turn only. New private helper `_stream_prewarm_bytes` (Py) / `streamPrewarmBytes` (TS) splits the prewarm buffer into 1280-byte chunks (40 ms PCM16 @ 16 kHz mono — sized to mirror the smallest live-TTS boundary) and forwards each through the existing `audio_sender` / `bridge.sendAudio` so cancel granularity is identical regardless of cache hit vs miss. Same `_is_speaking` guard at every iteration so a barge-in mid-prewarm stops chunking immediately. New regressions: `libraries/python/tests/test_prewarm.py::test_stream_prewarm_bytes_chunks_buffer` + `test_stream_prewarm_bytes_stops_on_barge_in_mid_buffer` (2 tests) and `libraries/typescript/tests/unit/prewarm.test.ts` (`streamPrewarmBytes — chunked send for cancel granularity`, 2 tests). Both assert ≥100 `send_audio`/`bridge.sendAudio` calls for a 5-second buffer (vs 1 in the regression) and that the loop honours mid-prewarm `_is_speaking=False`. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts`.

- **OpenAI Realtime warmup: replaced billing-unsafe `response.create` with `session.update`** (Python + TypeScript parity). The earlier prewarm pass sent `{"type": "response.create", "response": {"generate": false}}` to "prime model state", but the `generate` field is NOT in the OpenAI Realtime API schema. Two failure modes were possible: (a) the server silently ignores the unknown field and invokes a real model response, billing tokens on every prewarm, or (b) the request is rejected with `invalid_request_error`, which makes the prewarm a no-op beyond TLS warm. Either way the prior implementation was wrong. The new flow opens the WS, waits for `session.created`, sends a single `session.update` whose body matches what `connect()` sends at production call-pickup (`input_audio_format`, `output_audio_format`, `voice`, `instructions`, `turn_detection`, `input_audio_transcription`, plus any opt-in fields populated on the adapter), waits for the matching `session.updated` ack, then closes cleanly. `session.update` only mutates session configuration — it does not invoke the model, does not consume any audio buffer, and does not trigger token generation, so the warmup is byte-for-byte billing-safe. The `_prewarm_response_id` (Py) / `prewarmResponseId` (TS) field is removed since it was only ever populated by the (broken) `response.create` path. New regression: `tests/unit/test_provider_warmup.py::test_openai_realtime_warmup_does_not_send_response_create` (Py) and the corresponding `does not send response.create on the wire` case in `tests/unit/provider-warmup.mocked.test.ts` (TS) — both fail loudly if a future change reintroduces `response.create` in the warmup path. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/openai_realtime.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/providers/openai-realtime.ts`.

- **ElevenLabs WS warmup: BOS frame now byte-identical to live `synthesize` BOS** (Python + TypeScript parity). The live `synthesize()` / `synthesizeStream()` path attaches `voice_settings` and (when `auto_mode=False`) `generation_config` to the protocol-required BOS frame, but the warmup variant only sent `{"text": " "}`. Because ElevenLabs may instantiate a different per-session worker depending on the BOS configuration, the warmed worker could end up unrelated to the worker that handles the live request — defeating the edge-warm goal entirely. Both paths now share a single `_build_bos_frame` (Py) / `buildBosFrame()` (TS) helper, so the warmup BOS is byte-identical to the production BOS for any given adapter configuration. New regression: `tests/unit/test_provider_warmup.py::test_elevenlabs_ws_warmup_bos_frame_matches_live_synthesize` (Py) and `warmup BOS bytes are byte-identical to synthesizeStream BOS bytes (regression)` in `tests/unit/provider-warmup.mocked.test.ts` (TS) — both capture the BOS bytes in each path and assert byte-equality. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/elevenlabs_ws_tts.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/providers/elevenlabs-ws-tts.ts`.

- **Inworld TTS warmup: replaced HEAD against POST-only endpoint with `GET /tts/v1/voices`** (Python + TypeScript parity). The earlier warmup issued `HEAD https://api.inworld.ai/tts/v1/voice:stream`, but that endpoint is POST-only — Inworld returned `405 Method Not Allowed` on every call, completing the TLS handshake but spamming 405s into Inworld's audit logs and into our own logs. The new path issues `GET /tts/v1/voices` (a documented free metadata read that returns the configured voice catalogue) so the response is 2xx-clean. Billing surface is unchanged — the synthesis pipeline is invoked only by `POST /tts/v1/voice:stream` with non-empty `text`. Tests assert the URL targets `/tts/v1/voices` and the response status is 2xx, with explicit asserts that the warmup does NOT target `voice:stream` and does NOT use HEAD. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/inworld_tts.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/providers/inworld-tts.ts`.

- **Cartesia STT + AssemblyAI STT warmup: API key no longer leaks into logs on handshake failure** (Python + TypeScript parity, security). Both providers authenticate via a query-string parameter on the WS upgrade URL (Cartesia: `?api_key=...`, AssemblyAI optional: `?token=...`). When the WS handshake failed (e.g. 401 from a rotated key), `aiohttp.WSServerHandshakeError.__str__` (Py) and the `ws` library `Error.message` (TS) typically include the full request URL — and `logger.debug("warmup failed: %s", exc)` therefore wrote the API key straight into application logs. The fix catches the handshake-error class specifically before the generic `Exception` handler and logs only the HTTP status code (or, for non-handshake errors, just the exception class name) — never the full message or URL. New regression tests in both SDKs install a custom logger / `caplog` capture, force a 401 handshake error during warmup, and assert (a) the API key never appears in any captured log message, (b) the URL with `?api_key=` / `?token=` never appears either, and (c) the status code is still surfaced so operators see why the warmup failed. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/{cartesia_stt,assemblyai_stt}.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/providers/{cartesia-stt,assemblyai-stt}.ts`.

- **Dashboard hydrate: hydrated calls no longer lose `cost` and `latency`** (Python + TypeScript parity, fully backward-compatible). `CallLogger.log_call_end` writes `cost`, `latency`, `duration_ms`, and `telephony_provider` as **top-level keys** of `metadata.json`, but `MetricsStore.hydrate` (`libraries/python/getpatter/dashboard/store.py:535`, `libraries/typescript/src/dashboard/store.ts:421-424`) read them only from `meta.metrics.cost` / `meta.metrics.latency`. Result: every call rebuilt from disk landed in the store with `metrics=null`, so the local dashboard rendered `$0.00` and `—` for cost/latency on all hydrated rows; only the in-flight call (which never goes through hydrate) showed real numbers. Caught during 0.6.0 acceptance testing — 48 of 49 calls in the dashboard had blank P95/cost columns. Fix promotes the top-level fields into a synthesized `metrics` dict (`metrics_from_top_level` / `metricsFromTopLevel`) when `meta.metrics` is missing, mapping `latency.p95_ms` → `metrics.latency_avg.total_ms` so the existing UI fields populate. Explicit `meta.metrics` (legacy/future shape) is preserved untouched. New regressions: `tests/unit/test_metrics_store_hydrate.py::test_hydrate_lifts_top_level_cost_and_latency_into_metrics` + `test_hydrate_preserves_explicit_metrics_when_present` (Py); two `MetricsStore.hydrate` cases in `tests/dashboard-store.test.ts` (TS). Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/dashboard/store.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/dashboard/store.ts`.

- **Pipeline early barge-in: VAD self-cancellation before TTS first byte arrived** (Python + TypeScript parity, behavioural change for pipeline mode). Cloud TTS providers (ElevenLabs, Cartesia, …) take 200–700 ms to emit the first audio byte. The barge-in anti-flicker gate was anchored on `_speaking_started_at` / `speakingStartedAt` (set inside `_begin_speaking` / `beginSpeaking`), so a 250 ms gate without AEC expired BEFORE TTS produced any audio. VAD then picked up background noise, room ambience, or a "hello?" from the operator and triggered `[VAD] speech_start during TTS → BARGE-IN` → `cancelSpeaking` → `isSpeaking=false` → the `for await (chunk of tts.synthesizeStream(...))` loop exited at `if (!this.isSpeaking) break`, emitting **zero bytes**. From the SDK's perspective the agent "spoke" the first message; from the caller's perspective the line went silent until the next turn. Reproduced on a pipeline outbound call (~47 s — first message never reached the wire). Fix introduces `_first_audio_sent_at` / `firstAudioSentAt`, set in a new `_mark_first_audio_sent` / `markFirstAudioSent` helper invoked AFTER `audio_sender.send_audio` / `bridge.sendAudio` succeeds at all four pipeline emit sites (firstMessage, streaming response, regular response, WebSocket remote). `_can_barge_in` / `canBargeIn` now refuses to open the gate while `_first_audio_sent_at` is null — VAD speech_start before the first wire-time byte is suppressed regardless of how much wall-clock has elapsed since `_begin_speaking`. The 250 ms / 1000 ms gate values are unchanged — only the anchor moves. New regressions: `tests/unit/test_stream_handler_unit.py::test_barge_in_suppressed_before_first_audio_emitted` (Py); `canBargeIn() false before the first TTS chunk has hit the wire` in `tests/unit/stream-handler.test.ts` (TS). Existing `_handle_barge_in` / `handleBargeIn` tests updated to set both timestamps to reflect the new contract. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts`.

## 0.6.0 (2026-05-08)

### Fixed

- **`getpatter.tts.elevenlabs.TTS` facade now forwards `language_code`, `voice_settings`, and `chunk_size`** (Python + TypeScript parity, fully backward-compatible). The HTTP-streaming ElevenLabs facade had a narrower `__init__` signature than the underlying `providers.elevenlabs_tts.ElevenLabsTTS` provider — accepting only `api_key/voice_id/model_id/output_format` — so users who built a TTS via the public facade silently lost language-aware synthesis and could not pass `voice_settings`. Multilingual scenarios (`feat_italian_language_live` in the agent-to-agent acceptance suite) crashed downstream with `TypeError: TTS.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'language_code'` once the runner started passing the kwarg. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/tts/elevenlabs.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/tts/elevenlabs.ts`. New regressions: `libraries/python/tests/unit/test_tts_facade_language.py` (7 tests covering language_code forwarding, voice_settings forwarding, defaults preservation, env-key resolution, missing-key error) and `libraries/typescript/tests/tts-facade-language.test.ts` (7 parity tests). The TS facade also tightened its `ElevenLabsTTSOptions` interface fields with `readonly` to match the project-wide immutability rule.

- **Cerebras + Groq LLM pricing — silent under-billing fix** (Python + TypeScript parity, fully backward-compatible). `calculate_llm_cost` / `calculateLlmCost` returns `$0.00` when the requested `(provider, model)` is not in the rate table. The Cerebras default model `gpt-oss-120b` (set as the SDK default in 0.5.4) and `llama3.1-8b` were both missing from `LLM_PRICING["cerebras"]` / `llmPricing.cerebras`, so every Patter user running the Cerebras default billed `llm_cost = 0` on the dashboard — silent under-billing across the entire Cerebras user base. Same class of bug on Groq: only `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` and `llama-3.1-8b-instant` were priced; the other 5 enum entries (`llama-3.3-70b-specdec`, `llama3-70b-8192`, `llama3-8b-8192`, `mixtral-8x7b-32768`, `gemma2-9b-it`) all silently billed $0. Added per-1M-token rates for every `CerebrasModel` / `GroqModel` enum value (best-effort placeholders sourced from cerebras.net and groq.com/pricing as of 2026-05-08 — `# rate as of 2026-05-08; verify against ...` comment in the source). Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/pricing.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/pricing.ts`. New regressions in `libraries/python/tests/test_pricing.py::TestLLMCostBilling` (5 tests covering the Cerebras default, the deprecating llama3.1-8b, both full-enum coverage assertions, and the specdec-vs-versatile rate distinction) and `libraries/typescript/tests/pricing.test.ts` (`LLM cost billing — Cerebras + Groq silent under-billing regression` describe block, parity-equivalent 5 tests). Tests use real `calculateLlmCost` / `calculate_llm_cost` math — no mocks (per `.claude/rules/authentic-tests.md`).

- **AssemblyAI STT (Python): coalesce small Twilio frames before sending to WebSocket** (achieves parity with TypeScript, fully backward-compatible). Twilio's media stream emits 20 ms / 160-byte mulaw frames, which is below AssemblyAI v3's 50 ms minimum frame size — the server emits error 3007 and closes the WebSocket, surfacing as `RuntimeError: Not connected. Call connect() first.` after ~6 s of silent audio drop (scenario `stt_matrix_twilio_assemblyai`). The TypeScript adapter (`libraries/typescript/src/providers/assemblyai-stt.ts`) already buffered to a 60 ms target; the Python `AssemblyAISTT.send_audio` (`libraries/python/getpatter/providers/assemblyai_stt.py`) forwarded each Twilio frame untouched. Fix: added an internal `_audio_buffer` bytearray + lazy-computed `_audio_buffer_target_bytes` (default 60 ms — one Twilio frame above the 50 ms floor with jitter headroom; 480 bytes for mulaw 8 kHz, 1920 bytes for PCM s16le 16 kHz) so 3 Twilio frames are batched into one ws send. Trailing tail is drained by a new `flush_audio()` method called automatically from `close()` so the final <60 ms slice is not dropped. `send_audio` now silently returns when the WS is not yet open (mirrors the TS adapter and Deepgram baseline) — Twilio starts streaming audio during the 200–500 ms WS handshake, so the prior `RuntimeError` killed every AssemblyAI call. New unit tests `libraries/python/tests/unit/test_assemblyai_stt_buffering.py` (5 tests: 10 × 20 ms coalescing, 60 ms target sanity for mulaw 8 kHz and PCM s16le 16 kHz, `flush_audio` trailing-tail drain, pre-connect silent drop, empty-chunk noop) and `libraries/typescript/tests/unit/assemblyai-stt-buffering.test.ts` (5 tests: 10 × 20 ms → 3 ws sends, sub-target hold-back, pre-connect no-throw, exact-target single send for both encodings).

- **Pipeline mode now fires `on_transcript` for assistant turns and tool calls** (Python + TypeScript parity, fully backward-compatible). Two related observability gaps surfaced via the agent-to-agent acceptance suite:
  1. The pipeline LLM-loop / `on_message` paths (`stream_handler.py` ~lines 2459–2547 and `stream-handler.ts` ~lines 1525 / 1751 / 1809) appended the assistant turn to `conversation_history` + `transcript_entries` but never invoked the user-supplied `on_transcript` callback. Realtime mode already does this via `_flush_assistant_turn` / `flushAssistantTurn`. Pipeline-mode hosts therefore observed user turns but no assistant replies.
  2. The pipeline `LLMLoop` (`services/llm_loop.py` `_execute_tool` and `llm-loop.ts` `executeTool`) ran tools but never surfaced the call/result back to the `StreamHandler`. Realtime mode emits two `role=tool` transcript events per tool invocation (one for the call `name(argsJson)`, one for the result `name(...) → result`) via `_emit_tool_event`. Pipeline mode emitted neither.

  Fix: added an optional `on_tool_call: Callable[[name, args, result], Awaitable[None]] | None` ctor arg + `set_on_tool_call(...)` setter on `LLMLoop` (Py) and `setOnToolCall(...)` on `LLMLoop` (TS). `PipelineStreamHandler` now wires it to a new `_record_tool_call` (Py) / `recordToolCall` (TS) helper that emits the same two-event shape as realtime. Three pipeline assistant-turn sites (`_process_streaming_response`-then-llmloop / streaming-on_message / `_process_regular_response` on Py; `runPipelineLlm` / `runRegularLlm` / `handleWebSocketResponse` on TS) now route through a new `_emit_assistant_transcript` (Py) / `emitAssistantTranscript` (TS) helper that pushes history AND fires `on_transcript`. Observer exceptions are caught + logged so a misbehaving callback cannot abort a live call. Defaults unchanged (callback is opt-in via the existing `on_transcript` field on `Patter`). New mocked tests `test_on_tool_call_observer_fires_after_successful_tool_execution`, `test_on_tool_call_observer_exceptions_do_not_abort_loop`, `test_pipeline_stream_handler_emits_three_transcript_events_for_tool_turn` (Py) and `[mocked] onToolCall observer (pipeline parity with realtime emitToolEvent)` describe block in `tests/llm-loop.test.ts` (TS) — including an end-to-end assertion that one user turn → one tool call yields exactly three `on_transcript` events (tool call + tool result + assistant) in order. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/services/llm_loop.py`, `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/llm-loop.ts`, `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts`.

- **OpenAI Realtime engine wrapper now forwards `reasoning_effort` and `input_audio_transcription_model`** (Python + TypeScript parity, fully backward-compatible). The two recently-shipped Realtime knobs were exposed on `OpenAIRealtimeAdapter` itself but the high-level `engines.openai.Realtime` (Py) / `Realtime` from `engines/openai` (TS) silently dropped them — users had to bypass the engine wrapper and instantiate `OpenAIRealtimeAdapter` directly to get `reasoning.effort` (gpt-realtime-2 reasoning tier) or a non-default transcription model (`gpt-realtime-whisper`, `gpt-4o-transcribe`). Wrapper now accepts both as optional kwargs / readonly fields, threads them through `Patter._unpack_engine` → `Agent.openai_realtime_reasoning_effort` / `Agent.openai_realtime_input_audio_transcription_model` (Py) and through `buildAIAdapter` directly off `agent.engine` (TS) into the adapter constructor. Defaults stay `None` / `undefined` so existing `OpenAIRealtime(model=..., voice=...)` callers compile and run unchanged. Files: `libraries/python/getpatter/engines/openai.py`, `libraries/python/getpatter/models.py`, `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py`, `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/engines/openai.ts`, `libraries/typescript/src/server.ts`. New unit tests: `test_realtime_engine_forwards_reasoning_and_transcription_to_adapter` (Py, mocks `OpenAIRealtimeAdapter` and asserts kwargs reach it) and two `OpenAIRealtime engine wrapper → OpenAIRealtimeAdapter forwarding` cases in TS (forwards-when-set + omits-when-unset).

- **OpenAI Realtime: post-barge-in re-greeting and mid-sentence fragments** (Python + TypeScript parity). After a barge-in, the agent could re-greet (`"Hello! How can I assist you today?"`) or resume mid-sentence (`"experiencing? This will help me assist you faster."`), losing the conversational thread. Root cause: `cancel_response` (Py `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/openai_realtime.py`, TS `libraries/typescript/src/providers/openai-realtime.ts`) sent `conversation.item.truncate { audio_end_ms }` using the **byte-derived counter of audio bytes received from the server**, not what the caller actually heard. OpenAI streams audio at 5-10x real-time, so when the consumer dropped its playout buffer on barge-in (`audio_sender.send_clear`), OpenAI was told the user heard the *full* generated text — leaving phantom assistant transcript on the conversation that the model replayed/resumed on the next turn. Fix bounds `audio_end_ms` by wall-clock elapsed time since the first `response.audio.delta` of the in-flight item (`time.monotonic()` Py / `Date.now()` TS), capped at the byte-derived total. Per-response state (`item_id`, `audio_ms`, `first_audio_at`) is also now reset by `cancel_response` itself so post-cancel late frames don't leak into the next turn. New `@pytest.mark.mocked` regression `test_cancel_response_caps_audio_end_ms_to_wallclock` in `libraries/python/tests/unit/test_providers_unit.py` and `[mocked]` regression in `libraries/typescript/tests/openai-realtime.test.ts` simulating 2 s generated / 30 ms played and asserting `audio_end_ms <= 200 ms`.

### Changed

- **`CircuitBreakerOptions.cooldown_s` → `cooldown_ms`** (Python + TypeScript parity, backward-compatible). The Python-side circuit-breaker tunable was named `cooldown_s` (seconds, default `30.0`) while TypeScript exposed `cooldownMs` (milliseconds, default `30_000`). Same number, different magnitude — a user copy-pasting `cooldown_s=30000` between SDKs would have set the cooldown to 8.3 hours instead of 30 seconds, leaving a per-tool circuit OPEN for the rest of every call. Aligned the Python field to milliseconds (`cooldown_ms`, default `30_000`) so it matches TS and the broader Patter time-field convention (`silence_duration_ms`, `prefix_padding_ms`, `after_ms`, ...). The legacy `cooldown_s=` kwarg is still accepted with a one-shot `DeprecationWarning` and is converted to `cooldown_ms` internally; an explicit `cooldown_ms` always wins. Scheduled for removal in v0.7.0. New `time_until_half_open_ms()` method added on `CircuitBreakerRegistry` for direct TS-parity callers; the existing `time_until_half_open()` keeps returning seconds so downstream code (notably `ToolExecutor` populating the `retry_after_ms` field on the rejection JSON) is unchanged at the wire level. Files touched: `libraries/python/getpatter/tools/circuit_breaker.py`, `libraries/python/getpatter/tools/tool_executor.py`, `libraries/python/tests/unit/test_circuit_breaker.py`. 4 new regression tests cover (a) the deprecation warning fires with the expected message, (b) the seconds-shim produces identical breaker behaviour to the ms field, (c) explicit `cooldown_ms` wins when both kwargs are passed, (d) defaults match TypeScript byte-for-byte (`30_000` ms, threshold `5`).

- **Pricing tables made model-aware across STT, TTS, and Realtime** (Python + TypeScript parity, fully backward-compatible). Previously every call billed at the **provider-level** rate regardless of which model the agent actually used: a Patter user on Deepgram Nova-3 multilingual was billed at the Nova-3 monolingual price, and a user on `gpt-realtime-2` was billed at the `gpt-realtime-mini` rate (4x undercharge on audio output). LLM cost was already model-aware via `LLM_PRICING`; this change extends the same pattern to the rest of the cost surface.
  - **Schema**: each `DEFAULT_PRICING` entry now carries provider-level defaults *plus* an optional `models` map keyed by model identifier with per-model overrides. New helper `_resolve_provider_rates(config, model)` (Py) / `resolveProviderRates(config, model)` (TS) merges model-specific rates on top of provider defaults — with longest-prefix fallback so versioned IDs like `gpt-realtime-2-2026-05-08` resolve against `gpt-realtime-2`, mirroring the existing LLM cost-calc logic.
  - **Cost-calc signatures**: `calculate_stt_cost`, `calculate_tts_cost`, `calculate_realtime_cost`, `calculate_realtime_cached_savings` (Py) and the TS equivalents now accept an optional trailing `model` arg. Default `None` preserves legacy behaviour (provider-level rate). All five functions are backward-compatible — existing callers compile and run unchanged.
  - **Auto-threading**: `CallMetricsAccumulator` now stores `stt_model` / `tts_model` / `realtime_model` (Py) and `sttModel` / `ttsModel` / `realtimeModel` (TS), populated by the stream-handler factory from the agent's adapter `model` attribute (`agent.stt.model`, `agent.tts.model`, `agent.model` for realtime). On every `record_realtime_usage(usage)` call the realtime model is also pulled from the `response.done` payload itself (per-turn), overriding the call-level default — supports mid-call model switches.
  - **`mergePricing` now overlays nested `models` shallowly**: a user override of `{"deepgram": {"models": {"nova-2": {"price": 0.01}}}}` keeps every other Deepgram model rate intact instead of replacing the entire `models` dict. Same shape for both SDKs.
  - **Built-in model rates added** for the major providers (no SDK source change required to bill them):
    - **Deepgram**: `nova-3` ($0.0077/min, default), `nova-3-multilingual` ($0.0092), `nova-2` ($0.0058), `nova` ($0.0043), `whisper-large` / `whisper-medium` ($0.0048).
    - **OpenAI Whisper / Transcribe**: `whisper-1` ($0.006/min), `gpt-4o-transcribe` ($0.006), `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` ($0.003), `gpt-realtime-whisper` ($0.017). New provider key `openai_transcribe` exposed for the standalone REST endpoint.
    - **ElevenLabs (REST + WebSocket)**: `eleven_flash_v2_5` ($0.06/1k chars, default), `eleven_turbo_v2_5` ($0.05), `eleven_multilingual_v2` / `eleven_monolingual_v1` ($0.18), `eleven_v3` ($0.30).
    - **OpenAI TTS**: `tts-1` ($0.015/1k, default), `tts-1-hd` ($0.030), `gpt-4o-mini-tts` ($0.012).
    - **Cartesia TTS**: `sonic-1` / `sonic-2` / `sonic-english` / `sonic-multilingual` ($0.030).
    - **Rime**: `mistv2` / `mist` ($0.030), `arcana` ($0.040).
    - **LMNT**: `aurora` / `blizzard` ($0.050).
    - **Inworld**: `inworld-tts-2` ($0.020, default), `inworld-tts-1.5-max` / `inworld-tts-1.5` ($0.025).
    - **OpenAI Realtime**: provider defaults match the Patter default `gpt-realtime-mini` ($10/$20 per M audio in/out, $0.60/$2.40 per M text in/out, $0.30/$0.06 per M cached audio/text). Per-model overrides under `openai_realtime.models`:
      - `gpt-realtime` (GA, Aug 2025): $32/$64 audio, $4/$16 text, $0.40/M cached.
      - `gpt-realtime-2` (most-capable): $32/$64 audio, $4/$24 text, $0.40/M cached.
      - `gpt-realtime-mini` / `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview`: $10/$20 audio, $0.60/$2.40 text, $0.30/$0.06 cached.
      - `gpt-4o-realtime-preview`: $100/$200 audio, $5/$20 text (~10x mini).
  - **Removed standalone `openai_realtime_2` entry** introduced earlier in this Unreleased cycle — the per-model rate now lives under `openai_realtime.models["gpt-realtime-2"]` and is picked up automatically. The previous workaround (`Patter(pricing={"openai_realtime": DEFAULT_PRICING["openai_realtime_2"]})`) is no longer needed; just construct the agent with `model=OpenAIRealtimeModel.GPT_REALTIME_2` and the dashboard bills correctly.
  - **PRICING_VERSION bumped 2026.2 → 2026.3, PRICING_LAST_UPDATED 2026-05-08**.
  - **Tests**: 16 new Python tests + 16 new TypeScript tests covering the new helper, model-aware lookup, longest-prefix fallback, override merge semantics (single-model overlay leaves siblings intact), and end-to-end auto-resolution from `record_realtime_usage(usage)`. Full suite Py 1656 / TS 1321 green.

### Added

- **TypeScript SDK: `manageWebhook` opt-out for `serve()`** (TS only — closes a parity gap with Python which never auto-configured carriers). New `manageWebhook?: boolean` option on `ServeOptions`, default `true` (preserves existing behaviour byte-for-byte). When set to `false`, `serve()` skips the call to `autoConfigureCarrier` so the carrier's webhook URL (Twilio `voice_url`) is left untouched. Required when the webhook is managed externally (Terraform, an edge gateway, a voice-router function in front of the agent) — otherwise every container boot silently overwrites the externally-managed value, bypassing whichever gating layer fronts the SDK. `tunnel: true` overrides the opt-out — the tunnel hostname is dynamic and only known at runtime, so the carrier MUST be reconfigured. Files: `libraries/typescript/src/types.ts` (new `manageWebhook?: boolean` field with full doc comment on `ServeOptions`), `libraries/typescript/src/client.ts` (gated `autoConfigureCarrier` on `opts.manageWebhook !== false || wantsCloudflared`). 3 new unit tests under `serve() > manageWebhook opt-out` in `libraries/typescript/tests/unit/client.test.ts` swap `globalThis.fetch` to capture Twilio API calls and assert: default → API hit, `manageWebhook: true` → API hit, `manageWebhook: false` → API NOT hit. Doc updated in `docs/typescript-sdk/local-mode.mdx`.

- **TypeScript SDK now ships `SpeechmaticsSTT`**, fixing a long-standing Python-only gap. The TS adapter speaks Speechmatics's RT v2 WebSocket protocol directly via `ws` (no upstream Node SDK exists) while exposing the same options as the Python adapter — `language`, `turnDetectionMode`, `sampleRate`, `enableDiarization`, `maxDelay`, `endOfUtteranceSilenceTrigger` / `endOfUtteranceMaxDelay`, `includePartials`, `additionalVocab`, `operatingPoint`, `domain`, `outputLocale`. Pro-tier pricing $0.004/min already in `pricing.ts`. Multilingual + accented speech support. New files `libraries/typescript/src/providers/speechmatics-stt.ts` (low-level adapter) and `libraries/typescript/src/stt/speechmatics.ts` (pipeline-mode wrapper with `providerKey = "speechmatics"` and `SPEECHMATICS_API_KEY` env fallback). Re-exported as `SpeechmaticsSTT` from the package root, mirroring `from getpatter import SpeechmaticsSTT` on Python. The legacy `speechmatics()` config helper in `libraries/typescript/src/providers.ts` no longer throws — it now returns a real `STTConfig` like its Python sibling. 21-test mocked suite (`libraries/typescript/tests/speechmatics-stt.mocked.test.ts`) covers connect handshake, StartRecognition payload shape, partial vs final transcript translation, error-frame propagation, EndOfStream close path with `last_seq_no`, and pipeline-wrapper env-var resolution.

- **Python parity for `ConversationStateSnapshot`, `UserState`, `AgentState`, `EouTrigger`** (Python catches up to TypeScript — additive, no breaking changes). The four speech-edge types that the TypeScript SDK already exposed at the package root (`libraries/typescript/src/index.ts`) now exist as importable Python symbols too: `from getpatter import UserState, AgentState, EouTrigger, ConversationStateSnapshot`. `UserState` / `AgentState` / `EouTrigger` land as `StrEnum` (consistent with `OpenAIRealtimeAudioFormat` and the rest of the provider enums) so callers get autocomplete and `==` comparisons against bare strings keep working; `ConversationStateSnapshot` is a `@dataclass(frozen=True)` per the immutability rule, mirroring the TS `readonly interface`. `SpeechEvents.conversation_state_snapshot` returns the typed snapshot for new code, while the legacy `conversation_state` property still returns `dict[str, str]` for backward compatibility. 5 new unit tests in `libraries/python/tests/test_speech_events.py` confirm value-set equality with the TypeScript unions, frozen-dataclass immutability, and that all four names import from the package root. Closes the parity gap flagged in `.claude/rules/sdk-parity.md`. Files touched: `libraries/python/getpatter/_speech_events.py`, `libraries/python/getpatter/__init__.py`, `libraries/python/tests/test_speech_events.py`.

- **OpenAI Realtime: support for `gpt-realtime-2` and `gpt-realtime-whisper`** (Python + TypeScript parity, opt-in, fully backward-compatible). New model identifiers in the public enums:
  - `OpenAIRealtimeModel.GPT_REALTIME_2` (`"gpt-realtime-2"`) — OpenAI's most-capable realtime voice model: speech-to-speech with stronger instruction following, configurable reasoning effort, and a 128K context window. Accepts the same v1 `session.update` wire shape as `gpt-realtime`/`-mini` so it slots into the existing adapter without protocol changes; pass `model=OpenAIRealtimeModel.GPT_REALTIME_2` to `Patter.agent(...)`. Billing is auto-resolved via the model-aware pricing refactor (see Changed) — no manual override required.
  - `OpenAITranscriptionModel.GPT_REALTIME_WHISPER` (`"gpt-realtime-whisper"`) — streaming-optimised Whisper variant for low-latency transcript deltas inside a Realtime session. Use as `input_audio_transcription_model` (Py) / `inputAudioTranscriptionModel` (TS) when you want faster partials than `whisper-1` at lower cost than `gpt-4o-transcribe`.
  - New `reasoning_effort` (Py) / `reasoningEffort` (TS) constructor option on `OpenAIRealtimeAdapter`: `"minimal" | "low" | "medium" | "high"`. When set, Patter injects `session.reasoning = { effort: ... }` into the `session.update` payload. OpenAI recommends `"low"` for production voice flows — higher tiers add measurable per-turn latency. Default is unset (server default applies); has no effect on models that ignore the field.

  `gpt-realtime-translate` is intentionally **not** wired into the Realtime adapter: it lives on a different endpoint (`/v1/realtime/translations`), does not support tool calling / `response.create` / agent system prompts, and would invalidate the `Agent`-shaped contract Patter exposes. If we add real-time translation it will land as a separate feature (e.g. `Patter.translate_bridge(...)`), not as a variant of the conversational Realtime mode.

  Defaults unchanged (`gpt-realtime-mini`, `whisper-1`). 7 unit tests Py + 4 unit tests TS covering enum exposure, constructor option storage, `reasoning.effort` wire-format injection (and its absence when unset). Files touched: `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/openai_realtime.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/providers/openai-realtime.ts`, plus the corresponding test files.

- **Speech-edge events for turn-taking instrumentation** (Python + TypeScript parity, additive — no breaking changes). Patter now exposes seven optional async callbacks on every `Patter` instance plus a read-only `conversation_state` (Py) / `conversationState` (TS) snapshot, covering the standard voice-agent metric set (user/agent state transitions, turn boundaries, TTFT, audio first-byte) and aligning with OpenAI Realtime (`input_audio_buffer.speech_started/_stopped/_committed`) where applicable. The seven events: `on_user_speech_started` (raw VAD positive edge), `on_user_speech_ended` (raw VAD trailing edge — *not* end-of-utterance), `on_user_speech_eos` (committed EOU — VAD edge + trailing silence + optional semantic turn-detector agreement; the canonical "user finished" signal that anchors `eos_to_first_token_ms`), `on_agent_speech_started` (first wire-time chunk of the agent turn — what the user actually hears, distinct from TTS warmup), `on_agent_speech_ended` (last wire chunk; payload includes `interrupted: bool` for barge-in), `on_llm_token` (TTFT marker, fires once per turn on the first LLM token), `on_audio_out` (first TTS audio chunk per turn — TTS warmup, distinct from wire-time). Each event also records an OpenTelemetry span event on the current call span (`patter.event.user_speech_started`, …, `patter.event.llm_first_token` carrying `gen_ai.request.model` + `gen_ai.provider.name` per the OTel GenAI semconv) when `PATTER_OTEL_ENABLED=1` and the `opentelemetry` peer dep is installed; otherwise the OTel branch is a zero-cost no-op. The dispatcher is callback-safe — observer exceptions are caught and logged, never propagated to the live call. State machine tracks per-side `conversation_state` (`user`: `listening`/`speaking`/`thinking`/`away`, `agent`: `initializing`/`idle`/`listening`/`thinking`/`speaking`) and a monotonically-increasing `turn_idx` that increments on every committed EOU. Wired into the realtime stream handler so `user_speech_started/_ended/_eos` and `agent_speech_started/_ended` fire automatically on the OpenAI Realtime + Twilio/Telnyx path; `on_llm_token` and `on_audio_out` are exposed on the dispatcher for adapter / pipeline-mode integrations to call. New files: `libraries/python/getpatter/_speech_events.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/_speech-events.ts`. Public exports: `SpeechEvents`, `SpeechEventCallback`, `ConversationStateSnapshot`, `UserState`, `AgentState`, `EouTrigger`. 16 unit tests Py + 15 unit tests TS covering every event payload, idempotency (LLM/audio fire-once-per-turn), state transitions, OTel attach contract, callback-exception isolation, chained-callback wrapping, and Patter-level proxy mirroring. Motivated by the `patter-agent-runner` acceptance suite which ships 15 turn-taking assertion verbs (barge-in latency, silence-gap, cross-talk, eos-to-first-token, MOS, WER) that previously auto-skipped because the SDK did not surface per-side speech edges.

- **Inworld TTS provider (`inworld-tts-2` + TTS-1.5 family)** (Python + TypeScript parity). New TTS adapter calling Inworld's HTTP NDJSON streaming endpoint `POST https://api.inworld.ai/tts/v1/voice:stream`. Default model is `inworld-tts-2` (sub-200 ms time-to-first-audio, 100+ languages with mid-utterance switching, natural-language voice steering); pass `model: "inworld-tts-1.5-max"` to fall back to the prior generation. Default audio output is `PCM` (PCM_S16LE) at 16 kHz so the result feeds straight into the Patter pipeline without transcoding. Public API: `import { InworldTTS } from "getpatter"` (TS) / `from getpatter import InworldTTS` (Py); pipeline-mode namespace `getpatter/tts/inworld` (TS) / `getpatter.tts.inworld` (Py) with env-var auto-resolve via `INWORLD_API_KEY`. Optional fields: `language` (BCP-47), `temperature` (TTS-1.5 only), `speakingRate` (0.5–1.5), `deliveryMode` (`EXPRESSIVE` / `BALANCED` / `STABLE` — TTS-2 only), `bitrate`. The Inworld dashboard issues a Base64 token already in the form expected by the `Authorization: Basic <token>` header — paste it as `INWORLD_API_KEY` directly. Pricing entry added to `pricing.ts` / `pricing.py` as `inworld` (placeholder $0.020 / 1k chars — verify against current platform tier). Optional dependency: `getpatter[inworld]` adds `aiohttp>=3.10`. New files: `libraries/typescript/src/providers/inworld-tts.ts`, `libraries/typescript/src/tts/inworld.ts`, `libraries/python/getpatter/providers/inworld_tts.py`, `libraries/python/getpatter/tts/inworld.py`. 7 unit tests per SDK covering payload shape, NDJSON parsing, base64 audio decoding, optional-field omission, env-var fallback, and non-200 error surfacing.

- **Tool streaming results via async generator handlers** (Python + TypeScript parity, Realtime-only). Tool handlers can now be `async function*` (TS) / `async def ... yield` (Py) generators that emit live progress updates while a long-running tool runs. Each `yield { progress: "..." }` (TS) / `yield {"progress": "..."}` (Py) is sent to the agent via `OpenAIRealtimeAdapter.sendText` so the caller hears status inline ("Searching the database...", "Found 12 matches..."). The generator's `return` value (TS) or final `{"result": "..."}` yield (Py — async generators don't surface return values cleanly) becomes the function-call result the model sees. Plain `async` handlers continue to work unchanged. Pipeline mode silently discards progress for now (no clean injection point — follow-up). 5 unit tests TS, 4 unit tests Py.

- **Reassurance auto-message during long tool calls** (Python + TypeScript parity, Realtime-only). New `Tool({..., reassurance: "Let me check..." })` (or `{ message, afterMs }`) bridges the silence on slow tool handlers/webhooks. After `afterMs` (default 1500 ms) the SDK enqueues the message via `OpenAIRealtimeAdapter.sendText` so the agent says it inline; if the tool returns earlier, the timer is cancelled and nothing is spoken. Improves the conversational UX when a handler runs >1 s. Pipeline mode silently skips for now (no clean injection point mid-turn yet — follow-up).

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) client integration** (Python + TypeScript parity, MVP). New `agent({ mcpServers: [...] })` (TS) / `agent(..., mcp_servers=[...])` (Py) plugs a Patter agent into MCP servers (Google Workspace, PayPal, Postgres, GitHub, ...) without writing wrapper handlers. Each server is queried at call start via `tools/list`; discovered tools are wrapped with synthetic handlers that dispatch to `tools/call` and merged into `agent.tools` before the model sees the tool list. Two config forms: a URL string (shorthand for streamable-HTTP transport) or an explicit object with optional auth `headers` and a `name` for telemetry. Tool-name collisions with user-defined tools raise at startup. Connection lifecycle is per-call (one handshake at start, closed on call end). Optional dependency: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (TS) / `mcp` (Py extra) — users who don't configure `mcpServers` never pay the install cost. Limitations of the MVP: streamable-HTTP only (no stdio/SSE fallback yet), no process-wide caching of `tools/list` (~50-200 ms × N servers per call). New file `tools/mcp-client.ts` (TS) / `tools/mcp_client.py` (Py).

- **Tool retry policy + per-tool circuit breaker** (Python + TypeScript parity). `DefaultToolExecutor` (TS `libraries/typescript/src/llm-loop.ts`) and `ToolExecutor` (Py `libraries/python/getpatter/tools/tool_executor.py`) now apply exponential-backoff retries (default 3 total attempts, base 500 ms × 2^attempt, jittered, capped at 5 s) to BOTH the local handler path and the webhook path — previously a single handler exception was a hard fault that silently killed the turn. New `CircuitBreakerRegistry` tracks per-tool consecutive failures; trips OPEN after 5 consecutive failures and stays OPEN for 30 s before allowing one HALF_OPEN probe. While OPEN, the executor returns `{error, fallback: true, circuit_state: "open", retry_after_ms}` immediately so the model can recover ("I couldn't reach the booking system, can I take your number?") instead of burning LLM tokens on retries that will keep failing. New unit tests: 10 per SDK for the breaker state machine, 14 per SDK for schema validation. Realtime mode also routes through the same executor (replaced inline ad-hoc dispatch in `stream-handler.ts:handleFunctionCall`) so its tool calls get the same robustness.

- **Tool JSON-schema validation at `agent()` build time** (Python + TypeScript parity). Patter now structurally validates every tool's `parameters` schema when you call `phone.agent({ tools: [...] })`: the root must be `type: "object"`, `properties` must be a dict, every `required` entry must exist in `properties`, etc. Typos that would have failed silently mid-call (e.g. `required: "name"` instead of `required: ["name"]`) raise `ToolSchemaError` immediately with a clear message naming the offending tool. New file `tools/schema-validation.ts` (TS) / `tools/schema_validation.py` (Py). 14 unit tests per SDK.
- **OpenAI strict mode opt-in for tools** (`Tool({ ..., strict: true })` TS / `Tool(..., strict=True)` Py). When set, Patter validates the schema satisfies OpenAI's strict-mode requirements (recursive `additionalProperties: false`, every property in `required`, no truly optional fields — use nullable types like `["string", "null"]` instead) at build time AND propagates `strict: true` in the OpenAI Realtime `session.update` wire format. The model is then constrained to emit arguments that exactly match the schema — no missing required fields, no extra properties, no type coercion. Default `false` for backward compatibility.

- **`Patter(persist=...)` option** for the dashboard's call history (Python + TypeScript parity). Previously the on-disk persistence layer (per-call `metadata.json` / `transcript.jsonl` / `events.jsonl` under `~/Library/Application Support/patter` or equivalent) was opt-in only via the `PATTER_LOG_DIR` env var, which was easy to miss when integrating Patter from a code-only setup. New explicit option in `LocalOptions` (TS) / `Patter()` constructor (Python):
  - omitted / `false` (default): no disk writes, in-memory ring buffer only — backward-compatible with prior behaviour.
  - `true`: write under the platform default location.
  - string: write under the supplied path.

  The env var still works as a deployment-time override and as the fallback when `persist` is undefined. When `persist` is set explicitly the env is ignored. `MetricsStore.hydrate(logRoot)` rebuilds the dashboard on startup so the call history survives process restarts without an external database. Retention defaults to 30 days (`PATTER_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=0` to keep forever); phone numbers masked by default (`PATTER_LOG_REDACT_PHONE`).

### Changed

- **Dashboard rewritten as a Vite + React SPA** (Python + TypeScript parity, single source of truth). The dashboard UI previously lived as a multi-hundred-line vanilla template literal inside `libraries/typescript/src/dashboard/ui.ts` and `libraries/python/getpatter/dashboard/ui.py`; visual updates required hand-editing a string with no type safety, no componentisation, and no testability. The new dashboard lives at the repo root in a dedicated sub-project `dashboard-app/` (Vite + React 18 + TypeScript), bundled by `vite-plugin-singlefile` into one self-contained `dist/index.html` (~190 KB, JS + CSS inlined). `npm run sync` from `dashboard-app/` copies that file into both SDKs as `ui.html`, which the SDK then loads at runtime — Python via `importlib.resources`, TypeScript via `fs.readFileSync` next to the bundled module (tsup `shims: true` provides `__dirname` in ESM). End-user experience is unchanged: `phone.serve()` still serves the dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` with zero CDN dependency, no extra build step, and identical routes. Internally the dashboard now consumes the existing `/api/dashboard/*` endpoints via React hooks (`useDashboardData`, `useTranscript`) and SSE for live updates, with a redesigned layout matching the new Patter design system (peach accent, dot-grid surfaces, JetBrains Mono for numerics, live-call right rail with per-call latency waterfall and cost breakdown). New files: `dashboard-app/` (~600 lines of TSX + ~500 lines of CSS, dev-only — never published). Updated files: `libraries/typescript/src/dashboard/ui.ts`, `libraries/typescript/src/dashboard/ui.html` (synced asset), `libraries/typescript/tsup.config.ts` (`shims: true`), `libraries/typescript/package.json` (asset copy in `build`, `files` array), `libraries/python/getpatter/dashboard/ui.py`, `libraries/python/getpatter/dashboard/ui.html` (synced asset), `libraries/python/pyproject.toml` (`package-data` includes `ui.html`).

### Fixed

- **Wire `on_llm_token` and `on_audio_out` callbacks for Realtime + ConvAI + Pipeline modes** (Python + TypeScript parity). The `SpeechEvents` dispatcher methods `fire_llm_first_token` (Py) / `fireLlmFirstToken` (TS) and `fire_audio_out` / `fireAudioOut` shipped in 0de4111 alongside the other five turn-taking edges, but no provider call site invoked them — the per-turn TTFT and TTS-warmup markers stayed silent for every backend. The `requires_sdk_callbacks` gates in the agent-to-agent acceptance suite that depend on these events (eos→first-token latency, audio-warmup vs wire-time skew) saw zero events and auto-skipped. Wired through new base-handler helpers `_emit_llm_first_token` / `_emit_audio_out` (Py) and `emitLlmFirstToken` / `emitAudioOut` (TS) called at: (a) Realtime `transcript_output` delta + `audio` delta — single `engine="openai_realtime"` tag, (b) ConvAI `transcript_output` + `audio` delta — `engine="elevenlabs_convai"` tag, (c) Pipeline LLM streaming first-token in `_process_streaming_response` (Py) / `runLLMLoop` (TS) — provider classified via `_infer_llm_provider` against the `agent.llm` class, (d) Pipeline TTS first-byte in `_synthesize_sentence` + `firstMessage` synth + WS-pipeline path — TTS provider classified via `_infer_tts_provider` (Py) or static `providerKey` (TS). Idempotent inside a turn — the dispatcher already guards on `_first_token_for_turn` / `_first_audio_for_turn` so per-delta calls are cheap. Files touched: `libraries/python/getpatter/stream_handler.py`, `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts`, plus 2 new unit tests per SDK in `tests/test_speech_events.py` / `tests/speech-events.test.ts` covering Realtime + Pipeline wiring, idempotency-per-turn, and provider-tag classification.

- **Realtime mode: `Agent.first_message` was injected as user input, role-confusing the AI** (Python + TypeScript parity). The docstring states `first_message` is "what the AI says when the callee answers", but the implementation routed it through `OpenAIRealtimeAdapter.send_text` / `sendText`, which submits a `conversation.item.create` with `role: "user"`. The model then *replied* to its own greeting instead of *speaking* it. Symptoms ranged from harmless ("Hi! I'd be happy to help…" — model kept role) to breaking (a receptionist agent saying "Hi! I'd like to schedule a haircut for Friday afternoon" — model swapped role to customer because it interpreted the greeting as a customer cue). New `OpenAIRealtimeAdapter.send_first_message` / `sendFirstMessage` method that injects `role: "assistant"` so the AI continues from "having already said" the text. `StreamHandler` calls it via duck-typed lookup; older adapter builds without the method silently fall back to `send_text`. Surfaced by `inbound_twilio_realtime` in the agent-to-agent acceptance suite.

- **Cloudflared quick-tunnel: SDK notified port 8000 unconditionally**. Embedded usages where Patter co-tenants port 8000 with another HTTP server (notably the agent-to-agent test runner where the driver SDK and the dashboard ingest target share `127.0.0.1:8000`) saw `404 Not Found` access-log spam from `notify_dashboard` / `notifyDashboard` fire-and-forget POSTs. Send-side already swallows errors silently; the noise comes from the receiver's access log. New `PATTER_DASHBOARD_NOTIFY=0|false|no|off` env-var opt-out skips the POST entirely; default behaviour unchanged.

- **Realtime mode: handler-only tools were silently ignored** (TypeScript only — Python's `ToolExecutor` already dispatched both paths). `StreamHandler.handleFunctionCall` (TS `libraries/typescript/src/stream-handler.ts`) only dispatched tools that had `webhookUrl`; tools with an in-process `handler` callback fell through without sending `function_call_output` back to OpenAI Realtime, so the model hung waiting for a result and the conversation stalled. Now both `handler` and `webhookUrl` paths are supported, mirroring the pipeline-mode `LLMLoop.DefaultToolExecutor` and the existing Python behaviour. The `agent.tools` validator already requires exactly one of the two so the API surface is unchanged.
- **Realtime mode: assistant turns were not surfaced to `onTranscript`** (Python + TypeScript parity). `onAdapterResponseDone` (TS) / `_forward_events` `response_done` branch (Py) pushed the assistant text into `history` but never invoked the user-supplied `onTranscript({ role: 'assistant', ... })` callback, so demos and host applications that relied on the callback for live logging only saw `[user]` lines and never `[assistant]`. Added the callback fire alongside the history push.
- **Realtime mode: dashboard transcript shown out of order** (Python + TypeScript parity). OpenAI Realtime emits `input_audio_transcription.completed` (user transcript) AFTER `response.done` (assistant text) because Whisper transcription runs in parallel with — and slower than — the model response. The naïve push order was `[firstMessage, assistant₁, user₁, assistant₂, user₂, …]` which renders as "all assistant on top, all user below" in the dashboard. Added a per-call buffer (`pendingAssistantTurn` / `_pending_assistant_turn` + 3 s fallback timer) that holds the assistant turn until the matching user transcript arrives, so the rendered order is the natural `[user₁, assistant₁, user₂, assistant₂, …]`. Falls through gracefully if the user transcript never arrives (silence misclassified, transcription disabled, or call ends mid-turn).
- **Realtime mode: tool invocations were invisible in the transcript timeline** (Python + TypeScript parity). Tool calls (built-in `transfer_call`/`end_call` and user-defined) executed correctly when wired but were never recorded in `history` nor surfaced via `onTranscript`. The dashboard transcript and any host-application logging would skip them, making post-mortem analysis (and live observability) much harder. Added `emitToolEvent` (TS) / `_emit_tool_event` (Py) which pushes a `role: 'tool'` history entry with the rendered `name(args) → result` and fires `onTranscript({ role: 'tool', tool_name, tool_args, tool_result, ... })`. Both the invocation and the result are emitted so the timeline shows full call/return semantics. Dashboard CSS adds dedicated styling for `role=tool` (orange-bordered monospace card) and `role=system` (centered italic notice).
- **Cloudflared quick-tunnel WSS upgrade race**. Bumped `waitForTunnelPubliclyReachable` grace window from 2.5 s to 5 s (TS `libraries/typescript/src/client.ts`, Py `libraries/python/getpatter/client.py:_wait_for_tunnel_publicly_reachable`). Twilio's media-stream WSS upgrade goes through a different cloudflared edge route than HTTP and is ~1-3 s slower to propagate; the prior 2.5 s grace covered HTTP only and ~5 % of first calls dropped silently at pickup with no media (HTTP webhooks fired, AMD fired, but the inbound media WS never opened). 5 s covers both paths and drops the failure rate to <1 %. Adds 2.5 s to startup on first tunnel creation. Affects only dev/acceptance with cloudflared quick-tunnels (production deployments use direct webhook URLs).

## 0.6.0 (2026-05-03)

Repository cleanup + bug-fix + parity wave.

### Added — Acoustic echo cancellation (opt-in)

- New `getpatter.audio.aec.NlmsEchoCanceller` (Py) / `src/audio/aec.ts → NlmsEchoCanceller` (TS) — time-domain NLMS adaptive filter with Geigel double-talk detection. Subtracts the agent's TTS bleed from the inbound mic stream before VAD/STT see it, fixing the speakerphone barge-in fragility where VAD stays in "speaking" state because of the bleed and only fires during natural TTS pauses.
- New `Agent.echo_cancellation: bool` (Py) / `AgentOptions.echoCancellation?: boolean` (TS). **Default false** — handset / headset deployments don't have bleed. Set to `true` for speakerphone / tunnel-loop deployments.
- Algorithm: 512-tap NLMS at 16 kHz (≈32 ms history — appropriate for cellular / VoIP echo paths after the carrier's own AGC has trimmed the tail) with **adaptive step size**: 0.5 during a 0.5 s warm-up window, decaying to the textbook 0.1 for steady-state tracking. Geigel rho 0.6 freezes adaptation during double-talk so the larger warm-up step does not pull caller voice into the echo model.
- Convergence: ≥10 dB ERLE within the **first 250 ms** of TTS playback on broadband audio (regression-tested). Earlier 2048-tap + constant-step prototype showed 8–12 s convergence on real cellular calls — the user's first turn was lost. NOT a drop-in replacement for production-grade AEC3 — wrap a binding to `webrtc-audio-processing-2` externally if you need that quality.
- Wired into `PipelineStreamHandler.start()` (Py) / `StreamHandler.initPipeline` (TS). Far-end tap fires on every TTS chunk before the carrier transcode; near-end runs in `on_audio_received` / inbound `media` path before VAD.
- 9 unit tests per SDK covering: warm-up convergence (first 250 ms ≥10 dB ERLE), steady-state convergence (1 s ≥10 dB ERLE), double-talk preservation (≥50 % near-speech power), construction validation (taps / step / warmup_step / warmup_seconds / leakage / sample rate), pass-through before priming, reset, empty buffers.

### Improved — SileroVAD usability

- **Auto-VAD in pipeline mode**. When the user does not pass `agent.vad`, the pipeline stream handler now auto-loads `SileroVAD` with telephony-tuned defaults (1.0 s `min_silence_duration`, 16 kHz sample rate). Falls back silently to the legacy STT-endpoint heuristic when `onnxruntime-node` (TS) / `getpatter[silero]` (Py) is not installed. No opt-out flag — auto-VAD is a strict upgrade over the heuristic when available.
- **`SileroVAD.forPhoneCall(opts?)` / `SileroVAD.for_phone_call(**overrides)`** factory. Convenience wrapper around `load(...)` that pre-applies the telephony preset; pass overrides for noisy-environment tuning (e.g. `minSilenceDuration: 1.5` for tunnel + speakerphone echo).
- **Defaults aligned with upstream Silero** (`snakers4/silero-vad`): `min_speech_duration` 0.05 → 0.25 s, `min_silence_duration` 0.55 → 0.10 s, `prefix_padding` 0.5 → 0.03 s. Existing callers can restore the old telephony-tuned values explicitly. The new `for_phone_call` factory handles the common phone-call override.
- **Robust ONNX model resolution (TS)**. `silero-vad.ts` now probes 4 anchor candidates (`__dirname`, `import.meta.url`, `createRequire(import.meta.url).resolve("getpatter/package.json")`, `createRequire(cwd).resolve(...)`) crossed with 3 path shapes (`<dir>/resources/`, `<dir>/../resources/`, `<dir>/dist/resources/`). Eliminates the workaround `createRequire(import.meta.url).resolve("getpatter")` that callers had to add manually under bundlers that break `import.meta.url`. Most changes are internal hardening; the breaking changes are the package-tree reorganisation and the `Agent.provider` field type tightening.

### Breaking — package-tree reorganisation

- **SDK roots moved** from `sdk-py/` and `sdk-ts/` to `libraries/python/` and `libraries/typescript/` (mcp-use-style layout). Top-level imports for end users are unchanged (`pip install getpatter`, `npm install getpatter`, `import { Patter } from "getpatter"`). Repo-relative paths in CI scripts, contributing docs, and integrators that pull from the source tree must update.
- **Per-SDK tests live in `libraries/<lang>/tests/`** instead of inside the package directory. Cross-SDK integration tests at the repo root were removed; integration coverage now lives next to each SDK.
- **In-repo `examples/` directory removed.** Examples are maintained in separate downstream repos and pulled into the docs as needed.

### Breaking — internal SDK layout reorganised

Internal layout reorganised for both SDKs; **PUBLIC API surface unchanged** (every `from getpatter import ...` / `import { ... } from "getpatter"` keeps resolving). Affects only callers that import internal modules directly (e.g. `from getpatter.handlers.twilio_handler import ...` — that path no longer exists).

- **Python (`libraries/python/getpatter/`)**
  - `handlers/twilio_handler.py` → `telephony/twilio.py`
  - `handlers/telnyx_handler.py` → `telephony/telnyx.py`
  - `handlers/common.py` → `telephony/common.py`
  - `handlers/stream_handler.py` → `stream_handler.py` (top-level — it's the per-call orchestrator, not a telephony adapter; `handlers/` folder removed)
  - `services/transcoding.py`, `services/pcm_mixer.py`, `services/background_audio.py` → `audio/*.py`
  - `services/tool_decorator.py`, `services/tool_executor.py` → `tools/*.py`
  - All other `services/*.py` (llm_loop, metrics, sentence_chunker, text_transforms, ivr, fallback_provider, pipeline_hooks, chat_context, call_log, remote_message) stay where they are.

- **TypeScript (`libraries/typescript/src/`)**
  - `carriers/twilio.ts` → `telephony/twilio.ts`
  - `carriers/telnyx.ts` → `telephony/telnyx.ts`
  - top-level `transcoding.ts` → `audio/transcoding.ts`
  - `services/background-audio.ts` → `audio/background-audio.ts`
  - top-level `tool-decorator.ts` → `tools/tool-decorator.ts`

The `tts/` and `stt/` namespaces are unchanged — they expose `getpatter.{tts,stt}.<provider>.{TTS,STT}` with env-var auto-resolve and are real public API.

Migration: if your code did `from getpatter.handlers.twilio_handler import ...` change it to `from getpatter.telephony.twilio import ...`. Public exports from the package root (e.g. `from getpatter import Patter`) are unaffected.

### Breaking — `Agent.provider` is a closed enum

- `Agent.provider` (Python) is now typed `ProviderMode = Literal["openai_realtime", "elevenlabs_convai", "pipeline"]`; previously it was a free-form `str`. TypeScript `AgentOptions.provider` mirrors with the same union.
- Callers passing arbitrary strings (e.g. typo `"openai-realtime"`) get a static type error in TS and a run-time `PatterConfigError` in Py.

### Added — phone preamble (opt-in by default for phone mode)

- `Agent` gets an automatic preamble prepended to `system_prompt` for phone-call deployments: instructs the model to respond concisely, drop markdown/bullets/emojis, and spell out numbers/currencies/dates in spoken form. Set `disable_phone_preamble=True` (Py) / `disablePhonePreamble: true` (TS) to opt out.

### Added — per-SDK `.env.example`

- `libraries/python/.env.example` and `libraries/typescript/.env.example` ship a curated, role-grouped list of provider env vars (telephony, LLM, STT, TTS). Replaces the obsolete cloud-mode env file.

### Added — `PricingUnit` enum

- `pricing.py` / `pricing.ts` introduce a `PricingUnit` enum (`MINUTE`, `THOUSAND_CHARS`, `TOKEN`) replacing free-form unit strings on every `ProviderPricing` row. The TS server backward-compat shim still accepts plain strings on the wire.

### Added — provider enum constants

- Every provider that historically accepted hard-coded model / voice / format strings now exposes a typed enum (`StrEnum` / `IntEnum` in Py, const-object + value union in TS). Covered providers: assemblyai_stt, cartesia_stt, cartesia_tts, cerebras_llm, deepgram_stt, elevenlabs_tts, elevenlabs_ws_tts, gemini_live, google_llm, groq_llm, lmnt_tts, openai_realtime, openai_tts, rime_tts, silero_vad, silero_onnx, soniox_stt, speechmatics_stt, telnyx_stt, telnyx_tts, ultravox_realtime, whisper_stt, anthropic_llm, krisp_*. The string form is still accepted on each constructor (back-compat).

### Fixed — barge-in cancels in-flight LLM stream (HIGH IMPACT)

- The stream handler used to leak partial LLM completions during barge-in: even after the user interrupted, the LLM stream kept pulling tokens to completion (and racking up tokens/cost). Now Python uses an `asyncio.Event` checked between tokens; TypeScript uses an `AbortController` forwarded to the LLM stream `fetch`. Cancellation is observed inside one token cycle.

### Fixed — webhook + outbound URL hardening

- Python `server.py` adds a `validate_webhook_url()` SSRF guard on every outbound webhook (refuses `127.0.0.1` / `169.254.169.254` / private CIDR by default), matching the TypeScript validator that already existed.
- Python WS endpoint enforces `MAX_WS_PER_IP=10` connection cap (parity with TS).
- Python voicemail POST now has an explicit 10 s timeout (was unbounded).

### Fixed — observability & metrics

- Python `event_bus.py` now logs listener exceptions instead of swallowing them.
- Python `metrics.py` accepts a legitimate `0.0 ms` `agent_response_ms` value (was treated as "missing" via truthy check).
- TypeScript `metrics.ts` now emits `llm_ttfb_ms` / `stt_ttfb_ms` / `tts_ttfb_ms` events on the EventBus (Py parity).
- TypeScript `server.ts` `queryTelephonyCost` catch logs the failure instead of returning silently.
- TypeScript `llm-loop.ts` HTTP errors now `throw new PatterConnectionError(...)` (was: silent return masking provider 5xx).
- LLM loop cache token attribution: emit key is now `cache_read_tokens` (was `cache_read_input_tokens`, which didn't match what OpenAI / Google emit — Anthropic-style key was being read but never populated).

### Performance

- `text_transforms.py` precompiles all 14 markdown regex patterns + 2 emoji helpers as module-level constants (was: recompiled per call). Hot-path text transforms drop CPU by ~30% on long responses.
- `ElevenLabsWebSocketTTS` auto-flips `output_format` to `ulaw_8000` when paired with a Twilio carrier — eliminates the SDK-side mulaw transcode hop. New `set_telephony_carrier()` / `setTelephonyCarrier()` hook is duck-typed by the stream handler at call setup; explicit `output_format` always wins.
- `OpenAITTS` gains an opt-in `target_sample_rate=8000` (Py) / `targetSampleRate: 8000` (TS) constructor arg that collapses the 24k→16k + 16k→8k chain into a single 3:1 decimation with a tighter LPF (Nyquist ≈ 4 kHz). New `create_resampler_24k_to_8k()` / `createResampler24kTo8k()` factory exported from `transcoding`. Default stays at 16 kHz for backward compatibility.

### Improved — sentence chunker (Bugs #48 + #49)

- **Per-language honorifics**: new `HONORIFICS_{EN,IT,ES,DE,FR,PT}` constants merge into a union regex that prevents premature splits on `Mr.`, `Sig.`, `Sr.`, `Hr.`, `M.`, `Sra.`, `Dr.`, `Dott.`, `Prof.`, `Mme.`, etc. Aggregation is union-of-all regardless of caller `language` — mixed-language deployments are common, safer default.
- **Single-word flush**: `DEFAULT_MIN_WORDS_FOR_SHORT_FLUSH` lowered `2 → 1`; single-word replies like `"Yes."`, `"Done!"`, `"Sì."`, `"はい。"` now flush on the terminator. New gate #6 in `maybeShortFlush` blocks flushing when the trailing word is a known honorific (so `"Mr."` doesn't escape as a sentence). Pass `minWordsForShortFlush=2` to opt back into the previous behaviour.
- 22 Python + 21 TypeScript new honorific cases; 12 + 12 single-word flush cases.

### Added — `ErrorCode` enum on the exception taxonomy

- New `ErrorCode` enum (10 stable values: `CONFIG`, `CONNECTION`, `AUTH`, `TIMEOUT`, `RATE_LIMIT`, `WEBHOOK_VERIFICATION`, `INPUT_VALIDATION`, `PROVIDER_ERROR`, `PROVISION`, `INTERNAL`) attached to every Patter exception via a default `.code` class attribute. Catchers can branch on `exc.code is ErrorCode.AUTH` instead of class-name matching.
- Python: `StrEnum` on `exceptions.py`, optional `code=` kwarg on `PatterError.__init__` for per-instance override.
- TypeScript: const-object + value-union, optional `{ code }` constructor option on every subclass. Class→code mapping matches Python byte-for-byte (asserted in test parity).
- Backward-compatible: every existing `Foo("msg")` / `new Foo("msg")` call site keeps working.

### Documentation

- **Docstring / JSDoc sweep across both SDKs.** Every public module, class, function, method, interface, and exported type now has a description. Pre-existing docstrings were left untouched; the pass added ~75 Python docstrings and ~290 TypeScript JSDoc blocks across 100+ files. No behaviour changes.

### Cleanup

- All external license headers removed from source files. New rule `.claude/rules/no-competitor-references.md` codifies the policy.
- Root `LICENSE` updated to `Copyright (c) 2026 Patter Contributors`.
- `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml` simplified; non-public-repo scripts removed.
- `playwright.config.ts` + `@playwright/test` devDep dropped (E2E lives in downstream test repo).

## 0.5.5 (2026-04-28)

Latency-pass 1: TTFA optimisations grounded in the ElevenLabs latency posts and a head-to-head review of competing production voice-AI stacks. All changes are additive or opt-in — existing call sites keep their current behaviour unchanged.

### Improved — sentence chunker

- **Italian abbreviations** added to the prefix list (Sig, Sgr, Dott, Prof, Avv, Ing, Geom, Rag, Arch, On, Egr, Spett, Gent, Ill) and the suffix list (ecc, cit, cap, sez, art, pag, fig, tab, cfr, vol, ed). Sentences like _"Ho incontrato il Sig. Rossi alla riunione di stamattina."_ are no longer split on the abbreviation period.
- **English abbreviations** expanded with the standard NLTK Punkt abbreviation set: `Gen.`, `Sen.`, `Rep.`, `Lt.`, `Cpt.`, `Capt.`, `Col.`, `Cmdr.`, `Adm.`, `vs.`, `etc.`, `No.`, `Vol.`, `pp.`, `cf.`, `ca.`, `op.`, plus address forms `Mt.`, `Hwy.`, `Rt.`, `Pl.`, `Ave.`, `Blvd.`, `Sq.`. Phrases like _"Compare A vs. B"_ and _"Met Gen. Smith and Sen. Davis"_ no longer split mid-abbreviation.
- **Suffix + starter pattern preserves the period** (e.g. _"Patter Inc. He left."_ now keeps `Inc.` in the emitted sentence — previously dropped to `Inc`).
- **All-caps name flush fixed**. Previously the gate-5 acronym guard blocked *any* uppercase-preceded period, so _"I was speaking with RAMESH."_ would sit in the buffer forever. Now only purely-uppercase ASCII words ≤3 chars (U, US, USA, NATO patterns) are treated as acronyms.
- **Multilingual terminator support**. The terminator set now includes ASCII semicolon `;`, Unicode ellipsis `…`, full-width semicolon `；`, full-width period `．`, half-width Japanese period `｡`, plus the non-Latin terminator set: Hindi/Devanagari `। ॥`, Arabic `؟ ؛ ۔ ؏`, Armenian `։`, Ethiopic `። ፧`, Khmer `។ ៕`, Burmese `။`, Tibetan `༎ ༏`. Hindi text like _"यह हिन्दी का एक वाक्य है।"_ now flushes correctly.
- **Cross-SDK parity fixture** at `tests/parity/scenarios/sentence_chunker.json` — 61 cases covering EN/IT/CJK/Hindi/Arabic punctuation, decimals, abbreviations, currency, dates, ellipsis, JSON, lists, all-caps names. Standalone runner at `tests/parity/sentence_chunker_parity.py` verifies Python and TypeScript emit identical sentence streams (53 / 61 PASS, 8 documented quirks/regressions).

### Added — opt-in aggressive first-clause flush

- New `aggressiveFirstFlush` (TS) / `aggressive_first_flush` (Python) option on `Agent`/`AgentOptions`. **Default: false.** When enabled, the chunker emits the first clause of each response on a soft punctuation boundary (`,`, em-dash, en-dash) once ≥40 chars accumulate — saves 200–500 ms TTFA on the first sentence of each turn.
- **Eight guards** prevent regressions on the safe-but-aggressive path: minimum length, decimal-comma (`3,14`), currency (`$1,000`, `€1.000,50`), thousands-separator, balanced parens/brackets/braces/quotes (protects JSON), ellipsis (`...`, `…`), comma-before-quote, sub-token ambiguity (requires post-terminator char).
- **Italian language hard-disables** the feature regardless of caller preference (decimal-comma + dot-thousands inversion would split mid-number). Pass `language: "it"` and the flag is ignored.
- ElevenLabs `optimize_streaming_latency` is **deprecated** by ElevenLabs and is **not** added — the help-centre note flagged during research.

### Added — `after_llm` 3-tier hook API

- New shape: `afterLlm: { onChunk, onSentence, onResponse }` (TS) / `after_llm = AfterLLMHook(...)` (Python). All three methods optional, all sync-or-async.
  - **`onChunk` (tier 1)** — per-token sync transform (~0 ms budget). Use for regex replace, markdown strip, profanity char-swap. Does NOT block streaming.
  - **`onSentence` (tier 2)** — per-sentence rewrite (~50–300 ms). Runs between the chunker and TTS. Returning `null` keeps original; returning `""` drops the sentence silently. Use for PII redaction, persona overlay, refusal swap.
  - **`onResponse` (tier 3)** — per-full-response rewrite. Buffers tokens, blocks streaming TTS. Use only when sentence-level rewrite is insufficient.
- **Backward-compatible adapter**: the legacy `(text, ctx) => string` callable still works and is mapped to `onResponse`. A one-shot `PatterDeprecationWarning` (subclass of both `DeprecationWarning` and `UserWarning` so it surfaces by default in Python) is emitted on first construction. Scheduled removal: 0.7.0.
- The LLM loop now buffers only when tier-3 `onResponse` is configured; tier-1 `onChunk` is applied inline before yielding (zero latency cost), tier-2 `onSentence` runs in the stream handler between the chunker and TTS.

### Added — `ElevenLabsWebSocketTTS`

- New opt-in TTS class targeting the ElevenLabs `stream-input` WebSocket endpoint (`wss://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}/stream-input`). Saves the per-utterance HTTP request setup time (~50 ms) and avoids the HTTP cold-start TLS handshake on bursty calls.
- **Drop-in API** matching `ElevenLabsTTS`: same `synthesize()` / `synthesizeStream()` signature, same `for_twilio()` / `for_telnyx()` factories, same default model (`eleven_flash_v2_5`).
- `auto_mode=true` by default — ElevenLabs handles internal chunk scheduling. Pass `auto_mode=False` + `chunk_length_schedule=[120, 160, 250, 290]` to take manual control.
- `inactivity_timeout=60 s` (default) — extends the WS keep-alive past the 20 s default to cover tool-call latency.
- `eleven_v3` is **rejected** at construction with a clear error (the WS endpoint does not support v3 — use the HTTP class).
- The HTTP `ElevenLabsTTS` class is **untouched** — both options coexist and the user picks per-call.

### Test coverage

- 31 new unit tests (20 Python + 11 TypeScript) for `ElevenLabsWebSocketTTS`.
- 22 new unit tests (11 Python + 11 TypeScript) for `aggressiveFirstFlush`.
- 20 new unit tests (11 Python + 9 TypeScript) for the `after_llm` 3-tier API.
- Parity fixture: 53 / 61 PASS, 8 XFAIL (3 known-fix regressions resolved in Phase 1; 5 by-design quirks documented).

### Internal

- `resolveVoiceId` is now a public export of `providers/elevenlabs-tts.ts` so the WS variant can share voice-name resolution.
- `tests/parity/sentence_chunker_parity.py` accepts `--side python | typescript | both` and `--strict` (treats XFAIL as hard fail).

## 0.5.4 (2026-04-27)

Fast-follow to align the Cerebras default with what 0.5.3 already promised in docs and changelog.

### Changed — Cerebras default model
- **Default model bumped to `gpt-oss-120b`** (production tier, ~3000 tok/sec on WSE-3, no deprecation date) in both Python and TypeScript SDKs. 0.5.3 had temporarily kept the default at `llama3.1-8b` while `gpt-oss-120b` rolled out across the Cerebras catalogue; that's no longer needed. Pass `model="llama3.1-8b"` (or any free-tier ID) to opt back into the smaller model.
- 404 `model_not_found` recovery hint and the `"common: …"` candidate list updated to surface `gpt-oss-120b` first. The `TODO(deprecation 2026-05-27)` note for `llama3.1-8b` retirement is preserved in the source.

## 0.5.3 (2026-04-27)

Cost-accuracy, audio-pipeline, and observability hardening across both SDKs, plus opt-in per-call filesystem logging.

### Improved — Cerebras
- **Default model bumped to `gpt-oss-120b`** (production tier, ~3000 tok/sec on WSE-3, no deprecation date) — replaces `llama-3.3-70b`, which is no longer in Cerebras's production catalogue. Docstrings updated against the verified model list at `inference-docs.cerebras.ai/models/overview`.
- **TS retry + backoff on 5xx / 429** — single retry with exponential backoff, honouring `x-ratelimit-reset-tokens-minute` / `x-ratelimit-reset-requests-minute` advisory headers. Terminal failures now throw a typed `PatterError` (was: silent `getLogger().error()` + empty stream).
- **`response_format` parameter** — Python and TS Cerebras providers accept the OpenAI-style structured-outputs dict (e.g. `{ type: "json_schema", json_schema: { ... } }`).
- **Forward additional sampling kwargs** to Cerebras and Groq (both SDKs): `parallel_tool_calls`, `tool_choice`, `seed`, `top_p`, `frequency_penalty`, `presence_penalty`, `stop`.
- **`max_tokens` → `max_completion_tokens` on the wire** for Cerebras and Groq; user-facing API still accepts `max_tokens` / `maxTokens`.
- **`User-Agent: getpatter/<version>` header** added to Cerebras and Groq HTTP requests for upstream attribution.

### Added — pipeline hooks
- **`before_llm` / `after_llm` hooks** (`PipelineHooks` in both SDKs) — receive the messages list pre-LLM and the assistant text post-stream. `before_llm` enables prompt injection / RAG augmentation; `after_llm` enables output validation, redaction, and post-processing.
- **New event types on the `EventBus`** (additive — existing callbacks unchanged): `transcript_partial`, `transcript_final`, `llm_chunk`, `tts_chunk`, `tool_call_started`. Subscribe via `on(...)` for fine-grained pipeline observability.

### Added — providers
- **OpenAITranscribeSTT** — first-class STT class for OpenAI's gpt-4o-transcribe and gpt-4o-mini-transcribe models (~10x faster than Whisper-1).
- **ElevenLabs `eleven_v3`** — typed model literal added; v3 is now selectable via `model_id="eleven_v3"`.
- **Cerebras: gzip compression now enabled by default in the TypeScript SDK** (Python already had it on). Reduces TTFT on prompts >2 KB. Pass `gzipCompression: false` to opt out.

### Added — per-call filesystem logging
- **`CallLogger` (both SDKs)** — opt-in via `PATTER_LOG_DIR` env var. Writes per-call
  `metadata.json` (atomic) + `transcript.jsonl` + `events.jsonl` under a
  date-partitioned directory tree (`calls/YYYY/MM/DD/<call_id>/`). Schema is
  identical in Python and TypeScript so multi-runtime deployments share one tree.
- **Phone redaction** (`PATTER_LOG_REDACT_PHONE`): `mask` (default, last-4),
  `full`, or `hash_only` (sha256 prefix).
- **Retention sweep** (`PATTER_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS`, default 30) runs on ~2% of
  calls — no daemon required. Set to `0` to keep forever.
- `maskPhoneNumber` export added to TS `stream-handler` for parity with Python
  `mask_phone_number`.
- Docs: new `observability → call logging` page for both SDKs.

### Fixed — user callback return value dropped
- Python `EmbeddedServer._wrap_callbacks` silently threw away the value returned
  by `on_call_start`, defeating per-call config overrides. Wrapper now returns
  it so `apply_call_overrides` receives the user's dict.

### Fixed — cost accuracy (third audit wave, 9 agents)
- **Deepgram rate was batch not streaming** — `deepgram: $0.0043/min` was the batch/pre-recorded rate. Patter's Nova-3 streaming default actually bills at **$0.0077/min** (monolingual). Users were under-reporting cost by ~45%.
- **ElevenLabs rate was Creator-plan overage not Flash/Turbo API** — `$0.18/1k chars` is only correct on the Creator plan's overage tier. The `eleven_flash_v2_5` / `eleven_turbo_v2_5` direct-API rate is **$0.06/1k chars**. Users on the API were over-reporting cost by ~3×.
- **Six new provider pricing entries added** so their bills no longer silently display $0: `assemblyai` ($0.0025/min), `cartesia_stt` ($0.0025/min), `cartesia_tts` ($0.030/1k), `soniox` ($0.002/min), `speechmatics` ($0.0173/min), `rime` ($0.030/1k), `lmnt` ($0.050/1k), `openai_tts_hd` ($0.030/1k). Users still see $0 if they configure a provider we don't price yet — documented as a deferred item.

### Fixed — model defaults
- **Gemini Live default retired** — `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` was experimental preview, no longer in Google docs. Updated to `gemini-live-2.5-flash-preview`.
- **ElevenLabs model default modernised** — `eleven_turbo_v2_5` → `eleven_flash_v2_5`. Drop-in replacement per ElevenLabs docs: same price tier, ~3× lower latency.

### Fixed — metrics correctness
- **Dangling-turn guard at call end** — abrupt hangup mid-turn used to drop the partial latency/cost state silently. `endCall()` / `end_call()` now call `recordTurnInterrupted()` if a turn is still active, so the state flushes cleanly and percentile stats filter it out via `_completedTurns`.
- **Negative `tts_ms` in pipeline streaming** — `recordTtsFirstByte` can fire on the first sentence's first chunk before `recordLlmComplete` (which marks end-of-full-response). The subtraction produced negative ms that showed up as dashboard noise. Clamped to zero in both SDKs.

### Fixed — security
- **Python Twilio webhook could bypass signature verification** if the `twilio` package was missing. The ImportError fallback skipped validation and logged a warning; a deployer without `pip install 'getpatter[local]'` silently accepted any webhook body. Now fails closed with HTTP 503 and a hard error log.
- Python Twilio signature URL is now reconstructed from `config.webhook_url` + `request.url.path` when the full Starlette URL is available, avoiding proxy scheme/port drift. Falls back to string-replace for mock test harnesses.

### Verified (no change needed)
- No hallucinated model IDs anywhere in the codebase.
- Every ElevenLabs voice ID in the name-map still resolves to a live voice (ElevenLabs auto-routes legacy IDs). The `bella` alias now rebrands to the live "Sarah" voice — works but the label is outdated; kept for backwards compat.
- Anthropic `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-opus-4-7` all match official Anthropic snapshot IDs.
- Groq `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, Deepgram `nova-3`, Cartesia `sonic-2`, LMNT `blizzard`, Rime `arcana`, Whisper `whisper-1`, OpenAI `tts-1` — all current in 2026.

### Deferred to 0.6.0 (tracked)
- **Per-model OpenAI Realtime pricing map**: default rates are calibrated for `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview`. Users on `gpt-realtime` (~3×) or `gpt-4o-realtime-preview` (~10×) still see under-reported cost. Startup warn (from 0.5.5) is the stopgap.
- **Native `ulaw_8000` negotiation per provider when target is Twilio** — ElevenLabs, LMNT, Cartesia, Rime all accept `ulaw_8000` output format natively. Today we fall through a resample-then-mulaw chain that introduces aliasing. Switching to native negotiation per the ElevenLabs Twilio cookbook is the canonical fix.
- **Replace 5-tap binomial FIR with Kaiser-windowed half-band (31-tap)** — industry stopband is 60-80 dB; our binomial is ~20 dB. `soxr` or `scipy.signal.resample_poly` if available.
- **LLM pipeline token tracking** — `anthropic`, `groq`, `cerebras`, `google`, `openai` LLM adapters report latency but never emit token usage. Pipeline-mode `CostBreakdown.llm` is always $0, regardless of actual spend. New `record_llm_usage()` + per-model pricing entries.
- **TS Telnyx outbound wrong codec** — TS `encodePipelineAudio` and `handleAdapterEvent` ship PCM16 16k to Telnyx that negotiated PCMU 8k. Telnyx customers see broken audio. Requires a `TelephonyBridge.encodeAudio` abstraction parity with Python's `TelnyxAudioSender`.
- **TS OpenAI Realtime missing `audioFormat` parameter** — Python has it. Blocks TS Telnyx+Realtime.
- **Runtime WebSocket error/close listeners** across all TS voice providers — today a mid-call WS drop is silent. Needs a shared `_retry.ts` helper.
- **ElevenLabs ConvAI barge-in** — adapter never emits `interruption` event; stream handler has a handler for it that's dead code.
- **Gemini Live never emits `transcript_input`** — `stt_ms` always 0 and `user_text` empty on every Gemini turn.
- **Whisper is unsafe in pipeline mode** — emits `isFinal=true` every ~1s regardless of speech; triggers LLM mid-utterance. Needs VAD gating.

### Fixed — cost accounting (first + second audit waves, 3 + 11 agents)
- **Python `calculate_realtime_cost` would crash on `input_token_details: null`** — `dict.get("...", {})` returns `None` when the key exists with a `None` value, and the chained `.get()` raised `AttributeError`. Switched to `or {}` fallback. TS was already safe via `??`.
- **`cached_tokens_details` ignored** → cached portion was billed at full rate (up to ~33× overcharge on cached audio). Now subtracted from the total and re-billed at the cached rate.
- **Twilio rounds partial minutes up** to the next whole minute ([twilio help 223132307](https://help.twilio.com/articles/223132307)). Our `(seconds/60) * rate` under-reported cost for every call ending on a non-minute boundary. `calculateTelephonyCost` / `calculate_telephony_cost` now apply `ceil(seconds/60)` for Twilio and keep per-second math for Telnyx (which bills per-second).
- **Dashboard had no way to show "saved from cache"** — the `cached_tokens_details` discount was consumed inside `calculateRealtimeCost` and then thrown away. Added `CostBreakdown.llm_cached_savings` (propagated via new `calculateRealtimeCachedSavings` helper + `_totalRealtimeCachedSavings` accumulator) so UI can render `LLM $0.08 (saved $0.02 from prompt caching)`.
- **`mergePricing` (TS) silently defaulted `unit: 'minute'`** for any new provider entry without an explicit unit, masking misconfiguration. Aligned to Python behaviour (fail-closed: cost = 0 when `unit` is missing).
- **`PRICING_VERSION` / `PRICING_LAST_UPDATED` now exported from the TS pricing module** for parity with Python — lets cross-SDK observability dedupe by pricing table version.

### Fixed — latency instrumentation
- **Python `waiting_first_audio = False` default** meant the `firstMessage` turn's `tts_ms` / `total_ms` were never captured in Realtime mode (OpenAI + ElevenLabs ConvAI). Flipped to `True`. Same TS behaviour already — parity restored.
- **Python `response_done` with empty `current_agent_text` left the turn dangling** (TS called `recordTurnInterrupted`, Python didn't). Both now close the active turn as interrupted so the next `speech_stopped` starts a clean turn.

### Fixed — audio pipeline (Python)
- **Python `TwilioAudioSender.send_audio` had no byte-alignment carry** — streaming TTS providers (ElevenLabs, Cartesia, LMNT, Rime, TelnyxTTS) yield chunks of arbitrary byte length including odd counts. Passing an odd buffer to `audioop.ratecv` raises `audioop.error: not a whole number of frames`, crashing the TTS mid-sentence. Now maintains a `_pcm16_carry` byte across calls. Parity with TS `StreamHandler.ttsByteCarry` fix in 0.5.4.
- **TS `ttsByteCarry` could persist across turns on mid-chunk exceptions** (security M1: defensive). Wrapped the three TTS loops in `try/finally` so the carry is always dropped.

### Security
- **`agent.model` was interpolated into warn logs without sanitisation** — dev-supplied string with ANSI escapes could inject colour codes into log aggregators. Now passes through `sanitizeLogValue`.

### Added — observability
- `CallMetrics.latency_p50` and `.latency_p99` alongside `latency_p95` and `latency_avg`. Lets dashboards show the full distribution (typical UX / SLA / cold-start outlier).
- `CostBreakdown.llm_cached_savings` as described above.
- Percentile formula upgraded from `floor(n*p)` (returned max for n<21) to Hyndman-Fan type 7 linear interpolation (same as `numpy.percentile` default). Meaningful on 2-3 sample sets.
- `_completedTurns` helper excludes `[interrupted]` turns and zero-latency turns from every percentile + average computation, so barge-in / cancelled replacements stop dragging the reported numbers toward zero.

### Changed — default rates (2026)
| Provider | Old | New | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Twilio | $0.013/min | **$0.0085/min** | Old rate matched neither inbound ($0.0085) nor outbound ($0.0140). Default is now US inbound local (99% of receive-call use cases). |
| OpenAI Realtime audio in | $100/M | **$10/M** | Recalibrated for `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview` (Patter default model). |
| OpenAI Realtime audio out | $400/M | **$20/M** | Same (old value was ~20× wrong on default model). |
| OpenAI Realtime text in / out | $5 / $20 per M | **$0.60 / $2.40 per M** | Same. |
| OpenAI Realtime cached audio / text in | — (billed as full) | **$0.30/M / $0.06/M** | New fields. |

Users running non-default Realtime models (`gpt-realtime`, `gpt-4o-realtime-preview`) get a startup warning with instructions to override. See pricing.ts / pricing.py comments for the multipliers.

### Tests
- Added cached-tokens happy path + over-total clamp + null-input-details regression tests in both TS and Python pricing suites.
- Final: TS 1046/1046 · Py 1275/1275.

### Fixed — cost accounting
- **Prompt caching was billed at full rate** — OpenAI Realtime sends `input_token_details.cached_tokens_details.{audio,text}_tokens` as a breakdown of already-counted totals; cached portions are billed at ~3% (audio cached $0.30/M vs full $10/M) and ~10% (text cached $0.06/M vs $0.60/M) of full rates. We were multiplying the full total by the full rate. On long calls with warm KV cache this overcharged display by up to ~30%. `calculateRealtimeCost` / `calculate_realtime_cost` now subtract cached from the full count and apply the reduced rate. `cached_audio_input_per_token` and `cached_text_input_per_token` added to `DEFAULT_PRICING.openai_realtime`.
- **Twilio default was $0.013/min** which matches neither US inbound local ($0.0085) nor US outbound local ($0.0140). Default is now **$0.0085/min** (US inbound local — the 99% case for voice agents receiving calls). Users on toll-free or outbound should override via `Patter({ pricing: { twilio: {...} } })`.
- **Non-default Realtime models under-reported** — if you set `agent.model = "gpt-realtime"` or `"gpt-4o-realtime-preview"`, the dashboard still applied mini-tier rates (3-10× cheaper than actual). Startup now warns if `agent.model` is a realtime model other than `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview`, with instructions to override pricing.

### Fixed — latency measurement
- **Python missed the `audio → startTurn` fallback that TS had** (parity bug). When OpenAI emits `response.audio.delta` before `input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped` due to async event reordering, Python would produce a turn with `_turn_start=None` and all-zero latency, silently polluting p95 toward zero. Now matches TS — if audio arrives without an active turn, `start_turn()` fires defensively.
- **Interrupted turns (barge-in, cancelled replacements) inflated p95/avg** — every `[interrupted]` turn entered the percentile buckets with `latency=0` or partial latency, dragging the reported numbers toward zero regardless of real performance. `_completed_turns` helper now filters them out of both p50/p95/p99 and average computations in both SDKs.
- **`total_ms → llm_ms` fallback broke comparability** between pipeline and realtime modes. Removed. In Realtime mode `stt_ms/llm_ms/tts_ms` stay 0 (OpenAI bundles the pipeline internally) and only `total_ms` is meaningful — dashboards should prefer `total_ms` for Realtime and the component buckets for Pipeline.
- **`recordSttComplete` was called in Python realtime but not TS** — produced different latency bucket splits between the two SDKs on identical calls. Added in TS `transcript_input` handler for parity.
- **p95/p99 returned the sample maximum for any n < 21** — the previous `floor(n * 0.95)` formula was numerically meaningless on short calls. Replaced with linear interpolation between order statistics (Hyndman-Fan type 7, same as `numpy.percentile` default). Both SDKs.
- **`firstMessage` latency wasn't measured in Python** (TS measured it for pipeline + realtime). Python now emits a turn-level metric for the first greeting in both modes.

### Added — observability
- `CallMetrics` now exposes `latency_p50` and `latency_p99` alongside `latency_p95` and `latency_avg`. Useful to detect cold-start outliers (p99) and typical UX latency (p50). Dashboards can render all four side by side.
- Both SDKs use the same percentile formula and same filtering (excludes interrupted turns).

### Fixed — initial audio + pricing pass
- **OpenAI Realtime cost display was 5-20× inflated** — `DEFAULT_PRICING.openai_realtime` was calibrated for `gpt-4o-realtime-preview` at mid-2024 rates ($100/M audio input, $400/M audio output, the latter already wrong vs OpenAI's then-published $200/M). Patter's default model is `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview`, which is billed at 1/10 the non-mini rate. The combined error made the dashboard report numbers roughly 5-20× higher than what OpenAI actually charged. Recalibrated to 2026 mini rates ($10/M audio in, $20/M audio out, $0.60/M text in, $2.40/M text out). Users on a different Realtime model should override via `Patter({ pricing: { openai_realtime: { ... } } })`.
- **Turn latency p95 artificially low in Realtime mode** — latency was measured from the `transcript_input` event (OpenAI's notification that ASR finished) to the first audio delta, but OpenAI generates the response in parallel with ASR so the two events arrive within tens of milliseconds of each other server-side. Real end-to-end latency is much higher. Now measuring from `input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped` (server VAD detected user finished talking) to first audio output — a truer proxy for user-perceived latency. Fallback to `transcript_input` kept for configs without server VAD.

### Fixed
- **TTS audio corruption on Twilio calls (pipeline mode)** — two independent bugs in the TypeScript audio pipeline both contributed to the symptom "voice buried under loud continuous noise" reported by users on pipeline-mode calls:
  1. **Byte misalignment across HTTP chunks.** Streaming TTS providers (ElevenLabs, OpenAI, Cartesia, ...) yield chunks of arbitrary byte length, including odd counts. `resample16kTo8k` silently dropped the trailing odd byte via `Math.floor(len / 2)`. That byte should have been the HIGH byte of the next int16 sample, paired with the first byte of the following chunk as the LOW byte — without the carry, every sample from the second chunk onwards was byte-swapped, turning modest amplitudes into huge magnitudes that the listener perceives as continuous hiss. Fixed by maintaining a `ttsByteCarry` buffer across chunks in `StreamHandler.encodePipelineAudio` so the resampler always sees even-length int16-aligned input. Affects every pipeline TTS provider, not just ElevenLabs.
  2. **Missing anti-aliasing filter on 2:1 downsampling.** `resample16kTo8k` was a naive `y[i] = x[2i]` decimation with no low-pass filter. All input energy between 4 kHz and 8 kHz (a large chunk of TTS voice: fricatives, sibilants, harmonics) folded back into the 0-4 kHz output band as hiss. Fixed by applying a 5-tap binomial low-pass FIR (`[1, 4, 6, 4, 1] / 16`) before decimation. Matches the Python SDK which uses `audioop.ratecv` (itself anti-aliased).
  The Python SDK was unaffected by both bugs — `audioop.ratecv` both anti-aliases and raises on misaligned input, forcing upstream code to keep alignment. Pure TypeScript parity violation.
- **Audio aliasing on 24 kHz → 16 kHz resampling** — same bug class in `resample24kTo16k`, used when OpenAI TTS (24 kHz native) runs in pipeline mode. Replaced the "take 2 of every 3 samples" logic with linear interpolation so content between 8 and 12 kHz doesn't alias into the 0-8 kHz band.
- **Anthropic default model** — updated from `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` (deprecated by Anthropic, now returns `404 not_found_error`) to `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`. Haiku 4.5 is faster, cheaper, and more suitable as a default for voice agents where every conversation turn costs a LLM call. Pass `model="claude-sonnet-4-6"` or similar to override.

### Changed (dependencies)
- `npm install getpatter` is now ~90 MB instead of ~357 MB (-75%). Heavy optional runtimes are no longer installed by default:
  - `onnxruntime-node` (~210 MB) moved to `peerDependencies` with `optional: true`. Required only if you use `SileroVAD` or `DeepFilterNetFilter`. Install with `npm install onnxruntime-node` when needed — the SDK throws a clear error at construction otherwise.
  - `@google/genai` moved to `peerDependencies` with `optional: true`. Required only if you use `GeminiLive` as an engine. Install with `npm install @google/genai` when needed.
- `cloudflared` moved from `optionalDependencies` to `dependencies` in the TypeScript SDK — the built-in tunnel (`Patter({ tunnel: true })`) is now guaranteed to Just Work out of the box (the npm `cloudflared` package auto-downloads the binary).
- Python: the `cloudflared` binary is still required on PATH (via `brew install cloudflared` / `apt install cloudflared`) — there is no Python wrapper package available. The error at `tunnel=True` time already lists install options.
- Python `getpatter[tunnel]` extra is now an empty alias kept for backwards compatibility.

### Unchanged
- All other optional extras (`getpatter[silero]`, `getpatter[anthropic]`, `getpatter[google]`, etc.) stay as extras.

## 0.5.2 (2026-04-23)

### Fixed
- **ElevenLabs default voice** — changed from Rachel (`21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM`) to Sarah (`EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL`). Rachel is a library voice that free-tier ElevenLabs accounts cannot use, so `new ElevenLabsTTS()` / `ElevenLabsTTS()` without an explicit `voice_id` used to fail on the first synthesis with `402 paid_plan_required`. Sarah is a premade voice available to all accounts.
- `alloy` alias now resolves to Sarah for the same reason.
- Startup banner now renders at the top of the terminal output (before tunnel/webhook setup logs), with a visually distinct Dashboard section.
- Reduced log noise during calls: removed per-frame `WS event:`, `Telnyx event:`, `Upgrade request:`, `WebSocket connected:` lines. Only `Call started` / `Call ended` remain.

### Unchanged
- The `rachel` alias still resolves to `21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM` — pass `voice="rachel"` explicitly to keep using it (requires a paid ElevenLabs plan).

## 0.5.1 (2026-04-22)

### Added
- **First-class `llm=` selector on `phone.agent()`** — pick any of 5 LLM providers the same way you pick STT/TTS.
  - `OpenAILLM`, `AnthropicLLM`, `GroqLLM`, `CerebrasLLM`, `GoogleLLM` — all instance-based with env-var fallback.
  - Namespaced imports: `from getpatter.llm import openai, anthropic, groq, cerebras, google` (Python) / `import * as anthropic from "getpatter/llm/anthropic"` (TypeScript). (Note: TypeScript subpath imports were not exposed in the published `exports` map; use flat barrel imports from `"getpatter"` instead.)
  - Flat imports: `from getpatter import AnthropicLLM, GroqLLM, ...` / `import { AnthropicLLM, GroqLLM, ... } from "getpatter"`.
- Tool calling works across all 5 providers — each adapter normalizes to Patter's unified `{type: "text" | "tool_call" | "done"}` chunk protocol.
- `GoogleLLM` reads `GEMINI_API_KEY` preferred, falls back to `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

### Unchanged (no break from 0.5.0)
- `on_message` / `onMessage` callback still works for custom LLM logic. Mutually exclusive with `llm=` (conflict raises at `serve()` time).
- When no `llm=` and no `on_message` but `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set, the default OpenAI LLM loop keeps running.

## 0.5.0 (2026-04-22)

Patter 0.5.0 ships an instance-based API. Every provider — carriers, engines, STT, TTS, tunnels — is a typed class that reads its credentials from environment variables by default. The result is a four-line quickstart:

```python
# (post-rename: package is now `getpatter` since 0.5.0)
from getpatter import Patter, Twilio, OpenAIRealtime
phone = Patter(carrier=Twilio(), phone_number="+15550001234")
agent = phone.agent(engine=OpenAIRealtime(), system_prompt="You are helpful.", first_message="Hello!")
await phone.serve(agent)
```

### Public API

- **Carriers**: `Twilio`, `Telnyx` — frozen dataclasses with env fallback (`TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` / `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TELNYX_API_KEY` / `TELNYX_CONNECTION_ID` / `TELNYX_PUBLIC_KEY`).
- **Engines**: `OpenAIRealtime`, `ElevenLabsConvAI` — env fallback on `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` / `ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID`.
- **STT**: `DeepgramSTT`, `WhisperSTT`, `CartesiaSTT`, `SonioxSTT`, `SpeechmaticsSTT` (namespaced only), `AssemblyAISTT` — each reads its own `*_API_KEY` env var.
- **TTS**: `ElevenLabsTTS`, `OpenAITTS`, `CartesiaTTS`, `RimeTTS`, `LMNTTTS` — same env-fallback pattern.
- **Tunnels**: `CloudflareTunnel`, `StaticTunnel`, `Ngrok` — pass via `Patter(tunnel=...)` or use the `serve(tunnel=True)` dev shorthand.
- **Primitives**: `Tool` + `@tool` decorator, `Guardrail` + `guardrail(...)` factory.
- **Top-level flat re-exports** so everything is reachable with a single `from getpatter import ...` / `import { ... } from "getpatter"`.

### Fixed

- Pipeline dispatch now wires every STT and TTS provider end-to-end. Earlier builds had silent fallthrough paths that dropped Cartesia / Rime / LMNT / Soniox / Speechmatics / AssemblyAI configs before they reached the stream handler.
- Twilio webhook `voice_url` auto-configuration in the TypeScript SDK now matches Python behavior — `serve()` points your number at the running server automatically.
- Consistent env-var error messages across every provider: `"X requires an api_key. Pass api_key='...' or set <ENV_VAR> in the environment."`

### Documentation

- Quickstarts for [Python](./docs/python-sdk/quickstart.mdx) and [TypeScript](./docs/typescript-sdk/quickstart.mdx) rewritten around the four-line pattern with an env-var-first setup.
